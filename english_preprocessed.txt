judging from previous posts this used to be good place but not any longer
we there were four of us arrived at noon the place was empty and the staff acted like we were imposing on them and they were very rude
they never brought us complimentary noodles ignored repeated requests for sugar and threw our dishes on the table
the food was lousy too sweet or too salty and the portions tiny
after all that they complained to me about the small tip
avoid this place
have eaten at saul many times the food is always consistently outrageously good
saul is the best restaurant on smith street and in brooklyn
the duck confit is always amazing and the foie gras terrine with figs was out of this world
the wine list is interesting and has many good values
for the price you can not eat this well in manhattan
was very disappointed with this restaurant
ive asked cart attendant for lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away
had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish ive requested
food was okay nothing great
chow fun was dry pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share table with loud and rude family
we will never go back to this place again
went on day oyster binge with fish bringing up the closing and am so glad this was the place it trip ended because it was so great
service was devine oysters where sensual as they come and the price ca be beat
you ca go wrong here
every time in new york make it point to visit restaurant saul on smith street
everything is always cooked to perfection the service is excellent the decor cool and understated
had the duck breast special on my last visit and it was incredible
ca wait wait for my next visit
had my eyes on this place promising myself will one day give it try
and hate to say this but doubt ll ever go back
the food is very average the thai fusion stuff is bit too sweet every thing they serve is too sweet here
the only thing moderately enjoyed was their grilled chicken special with edamame puree
had never had edamame pureed before but thought it was innovative and tasty lrb could ve used bit more salt rrb
anyways if you re in the neighborhood to eat good food would waste my time trying to find something rather go across the street to tamari
the decor is night tho but they really need to clean that vent in the ceiling its quite un appetizing and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern
we ate outside at haru sake bar because haru restaurant next door was overflowing
what the difference between the two
their sake list was extensive but we were looking for purple haze which was listed but made for us upon request
the spicy tuna roll was unusually good and the rock shrimp tempura was awesome great appetizer to share
we went around on friday and it had died down bit by then so the service was great
we love th pink pony
the perfect spot
food awesome
service friendly and attentive
ambiance relaxed and stylish
do judge this place prima facie you have to try it to believe it home away from home for the literate heart
have eaten here handful of times for no reason besides sheer convenience
lrb hang out and live in the neighborhood rrb
the food is decent
however it the service that leaves bad taste in my mouth
happen to have policy that goes along with little bit of self respect which includes not letting waiter intimidate me make me feel bad asking for trivialities like water or the check
know you were too busy showing off your vintage tee shirt and looking bored but my agenda is here to eat and enjoy the company of friends seeking pleasant experience
well did find it there and trust have told everyone can think of about my experience
the last time walked by it looked pretty empty hmmm
this place has got to be the best japanese restaurant in the new york area
had great experience
food is great
service is top notch
have been going back again and again
tend to judge sushi restaurant by its sea urchin which was heavenly at sushi rose
it melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency not too fishy creamy and slightly buttery
the sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned
the rice to fish ration was also good they did try to overpack the rice
we took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it
went to this restaurant with woman that met recently
she lives nearby but had never gone to this establishment thinking that it might be too touristy
surprisingly nothing could be further from the truth
in the evening this place attracted well dressed with it ny crowd
the food was well prepared and the service impecable
going back
having hunted around for quiet romantic yet not hideously expensive restaurant stumbled across reviews for la lanterna and gave it shot
quite simply it like stepping out of manhattan and into haven of tranquility
the service was attentive yet unimposing the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced
the prix fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough lrb both in quantity and quality rrb
will be going back and heartily recommend it
ve had the lunch buffet at chennai couple of times when have been in the neighborhood
it is terrific as is the value
and there is much tasty food all of it fresh and continually refilled
am not vegetarian but almost all the dishes were great
frankly when you compare what you can have here for lunch versus mcds or so many other sandwich shops in the city there is no comparison
go hungry and enjoy
the food here is rather good but only if you like to wait for it
like the somosas chai and the chole but the dhosas and dhal were kinda dissapointing
the service varys from day to day sometimes they re very nice and sometimes not
the kitchen however is almost always slow
also specify if you like your food spicy its rather bland if you do
the ambience is pretty and nice for conversation so casual lunch here would probably be best
just went here for my girlfriends rd bday
if you ve ever been along the river in weehawken you have an idea of the top of view the chart house has to offer
add to that great service and great food at reasonable price and you have yourself the beginning of great evening
the lava cake dessert was incredible and recommend it
once you step into cosette you re miraculously in small off the beaten path parisian bistro
this tiny restaurant is as cozy as it gets with that certain parisian flair
the food was average to above average the french onion soup filling yet not overly impressive and the desserts not brilliant in any way
however go for the ambience and consider the food just companion for trip across the world
have never eaten in the restaurant however upon reading the reviews got take out last week
it was horrible
the pizza was delivered cold and the cheese was even fully melted
it looked like shredded cheese partly done still in strips
have eaten at many pizza places around nyc and this is hands down the worst
this has got to be one of the most overrated restaurants in brooklyn
the pizza is overpriced and soggy
yes they use fancy ingredients but even fancy ingredients do make for good pizza unless someone knows how to get the crust right
big disappointment all around
think ve had some the best meals of my life at minnow
the seafood is amazing there good wine list and the ever changing menu always offers some great surprises
the combination of super fresh ingredients in the dishes are unusual but really delicious
worth the trip from manhattan
was there friday night
best pastrami ever had and great portion without being ridiculous
and ve been to many nyc delis
my wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it
price no more than jersey deli but way better
as japanese native ve lived in the tristate area for over years but was just so amazed at this place
this place is the most japanese it can ever get
the signs the specials menus food and even all the waitstaff are all totally japanese
this place is worth an one hour drive
am so coming back here again as much as can
leon is an east village gem casual but hip with well prepared basic french bistro fare good specials warm and lively atmosphere
my wife and always enjoy the young not always well trained but nevertheless friendly staff all of whom have story
sit outside in the warm weather inside for cozy winter
decent wine at reasonable prices
have been dozens of times and never failed to enjoy the experience
our teenage kids love it too
everytime decide to try another place on the ues get angry that did just go to zucchero pomodori
this is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood
the service is excellent the decor is great and the food is delicious and comes in large portions
you ll pay at least double at any other italian restaurant in the city and most still do compare
partial to the gnocchi
this place is incredibly tiny
they refuse to seat parties of or more on weekends
the hostess is rude to the point of being offensive
the food was bland oily
just do understand all the hype
we went to ino for valentines
we have been to this place many times and always have great food wine and service
we were worried we would have trouble getting in but somehow managed to have short wait
as always we had great glass of wine while we waited
when we sat we got great and fast service
the people that work there are always so friendly you forget you are in new york sometimes
make sure you try this place as often as you can
this is fun restaurant to go to
the pizza is yummy and like the atmoshpere
but the pizza is way to expensive
large is and toppings are about each
went there for lunch and it was not as good as expected from the reviews read
sauce was watery and the food did have much flavor
if you like the food and the value you get from some of chinatown restaurants this is not the place for you
do think would go again
this place is great
had huge group for my birthday and we were well taken care of
the waitress was very patient with us and the food is phenomenal
service was prompt friendly and great
slightly on the pricey side but worth it
great pizza and fantastic service
there was small wait but shorter than expected
located at the end of magnificent block
very cozy and warm inside
will be back
this is the best sushi in new york city hands down
the place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic
get the tuna of gari
the one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side
planet thailand has always been hit with me go there usually for the sushi which is great the thai food is excellent too
with the great variety on the menu eat here often and never get bored
the atmosphere is the greatest but suppose that how they keep the prices down
it all about the food
went there with my friend last saturday
first it took us long time to find the place
we were tired and cold when we got to the restaurant then we sat down to begin ordering appetizers
but when we looked at the menu there were lot of choices most of them were dumplings in the appetizer section
then we ordered dinosaur rolls and white tuna sashimi
those rolls were big but not good and sashimi was fresh
they were dry and disgusting did even finish my first piece
hurley is like cheers where everyone knows your name and they are actually glad you came
try the crunchy tuna it is to die for
try everything for that matter it is all good
have been going there since it opened and ca get enough
first went here to enjoy their garden terrace
the food was amazing and the service was prompt and helpful but not over bearing or rushed
the steak tartare is great bet they fix it for you at the table
admittedly some nights inside the restaurant were rather warm but the open kitchen is part of the charm
great wine selection gigondas is worth the price and the house champagne is great value
it may be bit packed on weekends but the vibe is good and it is the best french food you will find in the area
have recommended the place to friends always gets good response
pizza the only pizza in nyc that should not have additional toppings the crust tastes like the best freshly baked bread
veal parmigana better than patsy
much more reasonably priced too
take all my nyc guests to vt
not sure where the previous reviewer lonk dined but saul is in great neighborhood and has great food
ve been there three times and have always had wonderful experiences
highly recommend it for special occasion it provides and intimate setting and nice service
not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and all enjoy mizu very much and we re repeat customers
even after they overcharged me the last time was there
make sure you have the spicy scallop roll
it delicious
moules were excellent lobster ravioli was very salty
took my mom for mother day and the maitre was pretty rude
told us to sit anywhere and when we sat he said the table was reserved
stepped on my foot on the second time he reached over me to adjust lighting
tiny dessert was just plain overpriced for what it is
the drinks are always welll made and wine selection is fairly priced
try their chef specials they are to die for
service is not exactly five star but thats not really big deal
downstairs lounge is always good attraction
raga is romantic cozy restaurant
the exotic food is beautifully presented and is delight in delicious combinations
it is also extremely well priced
the staff is incredibly helpful and attentive
the bar is very well stocked with interesting beers and well priced wines
this is one of my favorite restaurants and it is not to be missed
your friends will thank you for introducing them to this gem
when we stumbled on leon we thought that we had found quite the gem but we were certainly wrong
the waitress moved our table practically into the bathroom and when we asked to cancel our dinner orders because we did not want to eat sitting on the toilet we were told no
then to top things off she dropped used silverware on my boyfriend jacket and did not stop to apologize or clean the mess that was left on clothes
such disappointment
rude service medicore food there are tons of restaurants in ny stay away from this one
had grat time at jekyll and hyde
loved everythig about it especially the shows and actors
our server was very helpful and friendly
am bringing my whole family back next time
the food was good too
the tuna and wasabe potatoes are excellent
the outdoor atmosphere of sitting on the sidewalk watching the world go by feet away on th avenue on cool evening was wonderful
inside is little cramped but to be expected
service was prompt and courteous
this was repeat visit and we ll definitely be back again
great service great food
prices are in line
compared to other shabu restaurants around town this places wins hands down
but too far east
live block away and go to patsy frequently
the pizza is delicious they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap frozen shredded cheese common to most pizzaria
two complaints their appetizer selection stinks it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu
also because it is so thin it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling
so eat fast and order lot
wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the uws
by far the best salad have had in fast food restaurant
fine dining restaurant quality
over different choices to create your own
must try
on recent sunday afternoon friend and accidently found this great restaurant on our way to see the pulitzer prize winning play doubt
this was the perfect quiet relaxing and delicious accompaniment to our afternoon of theater
the chicken pot pie is excpetiona the cheeseburger huge and delictable and the service professional wan warm
with so many poor experiences to be had in the theater district is truly an excellent find
we will return many times for this oasis in mid town
grew up on these bagels
the staff is no nonsense
the food options rule
when lived upstate for while would buy freeze the bagels and they would still be better than any else
worth visiting the st ave spot because it is the original store
stumbled upon this second floor walk up two fridays ago when was with two friends in town from
being serious sushi lovers we sat at the sushi bar to be closer to the action
asked the chef what he recommends and he asked me if like uni
lrb for those of you who do know uni is sea urchin in japanese which happens to be my favorite rrb
he served me an uni hand roll which never had before and let me tell you it was heaven
aside from the sea urchin the chef recommended an assortment of fish including fatty yellow tail boton shrimp blue fin torro lrb fatty tuna rrb sea eel etc
the sake menu should not be overlooked
all in all this midtown gem instantly became one of my favorite sushi restaurants in the city
try the lobster teriyaki and the rose special roll
we visited orsay during ny restaurant week and tried their menu
service was very good prompt attentive and non intrusive
food was very good as well considering that we tried the budget selection lrb though wish the pork belly that ordered was roasted bit longer so that fat was more of melt in your mouth experience rrb
wine list selection is good and wine by the glass was generously filled to the top
traditional french decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain conversation
ve been to at cafe spice probably times it is probably still the best indian restaurant around union square
to sum it up service varies from good to mediorce depending on which waiter you get generally it is just average ok
seating is always prompt though the restaurant does fill up in the evening
food is usually very good though ocasionally wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders
as many other reviewers noticed your order is often slow to arrive this is particularly true in the evening but is not problem during lunch time
the decor is vibrant and eye pleasing with several semi private boths on the right side of the dining hall which are great for date
have never been disappointed in the red eye
the first time went and was completely taken by the live jazz band and atmosphere ordered the lobster cobb salad
ve never ordered anything else from their menu there no need to
it simply the best meal in nyc
you can not go wrong at the red eye grill
if we were to move from the upper east side we would genuinely miss this restaurant
we ve lived in the area for more than years
the restaurant is cute but not upscale
the food is diamond in rough the food is delicious and homemade with the perfect balance of herbs and tomatoes
would highly recommend it
it one of our favorite places to eat in ny
we had great time at the jekyll and hyde pub last night
we were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks
after really enjoying ourselves at the bar we sat down at table and had dinner
the server was really cool and served us our food and drinks with smile
the place decor and hidden bathrooms made for good laugh
highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks
if you are the type of person who likes being scared and entertained this is great place to go and eat
my husband and thougt it would be great to go to the jekyll and hyde pub for our anniversary and to our surprise it was fantastic
the have over different beers to offer thier guest so that made my husband very happy and the food was delicious if must recommend dish it must be the pumkin tortelini
the entertainment was great they have shows that go on through out the dinner
please take my advice go and try this place
its located in greenewich village
you will not be disapointed at all
our first time in new york and we had to try new york bagel
we were not dissappointed in the least bit by this little gem
the bagel was huge
they were served warm and had soft fluffy interior
the workers there also absolutely load the bagel with cream cheese lrb gets little messy rrb
loved it and would highly recommend
this was my frist time at cafe st bart and must say how delicous the food and the service was
when called this morning did think would be able to get in at but was able to get in along with four other guests
have to highly recommend the lobster roll not to much mayo you can tell it was fresh lobster
other guests enjoyed pizza santa fe chopped salad and fish and chips
highly recommend cafe st bart for their food the ambience and wonderful service
all the staff is absolutely professional
sometimes see the waiters do have enough knowledge of their dishes
but they do
lrb that is must but not every restaurant can do rrb
if you want to dine with large party recommend to make reservation basement
there nice and quiet small but enough for lrb or more rrb
this restaurant was way overhyped
my chow fun and chow see was really bland and oily
okay do mind the oily part lrb cause most are cooked that way rrb but it was way too bland
the scallion pancakes and fried dumplings were nothing out of the ordinary
the service was the only thing good about this restaurant
it boring on the inside and our sushi was pretty below average the tuna was soggy and the other rolls had no flavor
definitely would go back
there are many thai places in the city but so far toons is
their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic
the price is reasonable although the service is poor
fresh restaurant was amazing food was delicious and of course fresh
great for romantic evening or fun evening with friends
will be going back very soon
keep up the good work
hats off to the chef
am not the most experienced person when it comes to thai food but my friend who took me there is
he has visited thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine
it was wonderful
the salads are delicious both refreshing and very spicy
we had pam special fried fish and it was amazing
too large for just two people but nothing was left
unbelievable
had late night dinner on saturday night
great vibe lots of people
my husband and both ordered the steak medium
my husbands was perfect my was well done and dry
did complain liked the atmosphere so much
will give it another chance before write it off
visited there while on vacation and reading the reviews
on hot day it was fabulous to stop in and enjoy lunch
ambience is so cute and quaint good for business although we were there on vacation
salads were fantastic
although we were looking for regular lettuce and some walnuts the salads we got were great
ingredients are organic which is real plus for me
we will be back
this is some really good inexpensive sushi
it costs extra to turn regular roll into an inside out roll but the roll more than triples in size and that not just from the rice
the spicy tuna roll is huge and probably the best that ve had at this price range
the yellowtail was particularly good as well
have reservations about the all you can eat deal however the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than by just going off the menu
in any event this is place ll be sure to stop by again when in this part of town
big wong gets big ups for fine establishment
they have it all great price food and service
the atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can
the food is prepared quickly and efficiently
and it all comes at very reasonable price lrb congee noodles and rice dishes are no more than each rrb
the takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well
this place is always very crowded and popular
went here on friend reccomendation
enjoyed very nice caesar salad while my wife had arugula and goat cheese both very tasty
we both opted for pasta dish and they were served timely and fresh
we concluded with tiramisu chocolate cake both were delicious
we go back again
recently went to this restaurant with some co workers for lunch and had an amazing time
the staff was accomodating the food was absolutely delicious and the place is lovely
we even had visit from the manager who wanted to make sure we were enjoying ourselves
yes the prices are high but felt it was worth it
we all felt it was worth it
sometimes get good food and ok service
sometimes get bad food and bad service sometimes get good good and bad service
it is not consistent
really depends on your luck
the place is bistro which means simple dishes and wine served efficiently in bustling atmosphere
and where does patis go wrong no where
you are not eating haut cuisine with subtle hints of whatever but cassuolet steake fritte tripe stew etc simple stuff
and evaluated on those terms pastis is simply wonderful
right off the in brooklyn this is nice cozy place with good pizza
mine was little burnt but still delicious with goat cheese and panchetta lrb raddichio was kind of bitter though rrb
my friend got the mushroom pizza which tasted better
the sangria was pretty tasty and good on hot muggy day
kind of small place but guess if they are not too busy might be able to fit group or kids
overall would recommend it and go back again
coming from boston this place is like emma pizza in kendall square in cambridge lrb although they have more funky toppings rrb
started out with bombay beer which was big enough for two
for dinner had the chicken tikka masala and some garlic naan
mmmmm it was delicious
service was slow but the people were friendly
it nice place to relax and have conversation
ca wait to go back
we have lived in chelsea for two years and have never noticed this restaurant
the food is authentic italian delicious
pizza is terrific as is homemade pasta
ambience is delightful service impeccable
still mad that had to pay for lousy food
the hanger steak was like rubber and the tuna was flavorless not to mention it tasted like it had just been thawed
service was also horrible and the ambience is not that great
do not try unless you re just going there to hang out like the rest of the hipsters who apparently have no sense of taste
go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try
this is my first time writing review for restaurant because the food and service was excellent
the filet mignon dish was superb
would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices
it small cute restaurant
absolutely love this place
from the street it looks very hidden and is actually an old warehouse
like the ambience it very dark and original
came here for my friend birthday and keep coming back ever since
the sushi is amazing
and amazingly cheap
big thumbs up
very affordable and excellent ambient
we ordered some beef and noodle soup dishes from the thai section of the menu but nothing we got was thai
we were very disappointed
we wo go to this place again for good meal
however think this place is good hang out spot
next time we would dare ordering anything else other than some simple asian appetizers and drinks
my girlfriend and stumbled onto this hopping place the other night and had great time
the pizza and wine were excellent the service too but what really made this place was the backyard dining area
it is one the nicest outdoor restaurants have ever seen in ny am from italy and this place rivals the ones in my country
they tell me they are going to cover the garden in glass for the winter so looking forward to going there on snowy night to enjoy it
check this place out
highly recommended
first of all this place is not romantic as claimed by citysearch editorial review
either that or the editor idea of romance must be sharing conversation with the next table while trying to speak louder than the traffic on th
the tables are crammed way too close the menu is typical of any italian restaurant and the wine list is simply overpriced
slightly above average wines start at with only one selection listed at
service is not what one would expect from joint in this price category
for instance plates were just dumped on the table was handed the wine list upside down etc
somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service
to be completely fair the only redeeming factor was the food which was above average but could make up for all the other deficiencies of teodora
to celebrate birthday three of us went to mare anticipating great food
not one of our meals was edible bland and or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring
fish was overdone
cute place nice wait staff but would never go there again
someone else recommended the dessert we also left that
one of us actually liked the expresso that it
skip this restaurant it big disappointment
myagi is one of my favorite restaurants in the city the place the negative reviews describe sound like they were somewhere else
ve never had bad service and the fish is fresh and delicious
their tuna tartar appetizer is to die for
come from family of pizzeria owners and almost ashamed to say that the pizza in fornino blows my families receipies away
it is simply amazing
the place is so cool and the service is prompt and curtious
highly recommend to anyone to give this place try
you will find yourself returning quite often
please do tell anyone in my family eat there
lol
restaurant that does try to do anything except serve great food with great service in pleasant atmosphere
no gimmicks here the food speaks for itself in its freshness and preparation
the dining room is quietly elegant with no music to shout over how refreshing
the service was impeccable and unobtrusive the staff knows what they are there to do to know their menu present your meal and attend to your needs
looking around saw room full of new yorkers enjoying real meal in real restaurant not clubhouse of the fabulous trying to be seen
beautiful experience
the view is breathtaking the service is top notch the ambiance is wonderfull
the staff offers impeccable service
had lobster bisque it has oz of maine lobster in it
my boyfriend had the new england chowder it was good but think the award should go to the lobster bisque
had filet mignon with garlic mash
it was divine melts in your mouth
my boyfriend had prime rib it was good
we did want bottle of bubbly on weekday so we each got little bottles of korbett it was just enough
we had lava cake we ordered when our food came it takes at least to make it
it cuz it so good you need to taste it
all in all we re already coming up with excuses to go ahead really soon in the next few wks
my wife and ate here earlier this week and have not stopped ranting and raving about the food
if you like spicy food get the chicken vindaloo
it very spicy but not offensive
we will definitely go back
go to volare for st class service and terrific food
the portions are large and the servers always surprise us with different starter
the wine list is excellent
the food is amazing especially if you get the chef tasting menu and your favourite bottle lrb or two rrb of wine from an extensive selection of wines
the place is small and intimate and you may feel little crowded but the service is excellent and it great for friends out romantic date or special occassion
people dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans
the food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you do like
recommendations of course are required
please be aware that it cash or amex only
with the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering the food here was decent not great
the menu is very limited think we counted or entrees
we ordered the special grilled branzino that was so infused with bone it was difficult to eat
the decor in this place is very diner ish and the kind of place you expect in the east village not romantic just simple small and sparse
problem is nothing at prune is particularly memorable
no plans to return anytime soon
this place is so much fun
our family never expected such incredible entertainment in restaurant
this place must have cost the owners afortune to build
think the stuff was better than disney
our food was great too
and really large portions
the staff was the friendliest that have seen in new york
we will go back every time we are in the city
if you want something really different than try jekyll and hyde
it is lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of disney type special effects
the food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions
highly recommend it
am going to the mid town location next
the place is lot of fun
my six year old loved it
the characters really make for an enjoyable experience
the food however is what one might expect
it is very overpriced and not very tasty
however think jeckll and hydes is one of those places that is fun to do once
we had good time
went there with my wife and we had to wait for table even though you could see there many that were empty with not reservation sigh on them
service was slow had to wait to order and get food although not crowded
drinks way over priced
food was good not great not worth the wait or another visit
great pizza for lunch place
service was quick
the pizza was great
and it was quick which is very important
have the iced tea
it was wonderful
whenever you need sushi fix mizu will be there with quality fish and great service
delivery is fast too
great friendly service fast seating fast delivery excellent sushi
little overpriced but worth it once you take bite
growing up in ny have eaten my share of bagels
ess bagel lrb either by sty town or midtown rrb is by far the best bagel in ny
the bagels always warm soft on the inside crispy on the outside and enormous in size
they have huge selection of different cream cheeses and all of their salads are great
the lox is always fresh too
highly recommended to all
have to agree with the previous reviewer
do get it either
not impressed with the food
prices too high for this cramped and unappealing resturant
zero ambiance to boot
thought this place was totally overrated
everything we had was good or ok but definitely nothing great
the ambience was nice but service was so great
when you add it all together it just does seem worth it to me especially considering the prices
this is the best shabu shabu restaurant in the try state area
have lived in japan for years and the taste of the food and the feel of the restaurant is like being back in japan
thius is must for anyone who loves shabu shabu
the atmosphere is nothing special but it feels like sushi establishment in tokyo
the owner and staff are all japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance
despite slightly limited menu everything prepared is done to perfection ultra fresh and work of food art
must give it yon out of yon stars
taxan delicious
arigato gozimas yuka
this restaurant was recommended by local as matter of fact he made the reservation for us and said we would not be disappointed
we were
the prices were cheap compared to the quality of service and food
we liked it so much that we will always make it point to dine here when we visit new york
went there for an office lunch
the location and ambience is ok but the food is what makes up for it
there is lot of variety even for people who eat vegetarian like me
try green curry with vegetables
the quantity is also very good you will come out satisfied
the service is ok some of the people did get what they asked for
was there on sat for my birthday and we had an excellent time
had the best ravioli ever
the wine the service was very good too
moderate prices
little noise but think that was because of our party
molto bene
this quaint and romantic trattoria is at the top of my manhattan restaurant list
the food is delicious from the specials to the regular menu fare the dishes are never disappointment
whether it the parmesean porcini souffle or the lamb glazed with balsamic vinegar you will surely be transported to northern italy with one bite
although the tables may be closely situated the candle light food quality and service overcompensate
guaranteeed delight
have known about this secret for the last years emilio lrb the godfather rrb has continued to serve food and wine for the gods at mortal prices
if you go try the marinara arrabiatta sauce the mozzarella en carozza is mmmmmmmm everything is just delicious
check out the secret back room
old school meets new world
pray it stays open forever
thank you emilio
ciao bella
found the food service and value exceptional everytime have been there
the food was authentic
felt as though were eating in paris
the service was excellent friendly and attentive
the prices are wonderfully low
very good wine choices
ca believe people complain about no cheese sticks
who has room for cheesesticks with the best pizza in nyc
get the pepperoni yum and family style salad
great staff
always great service
go twice month
fantastic
the food is good ca lie
but the staff was so horrible to us
the hostess and the waitress were incredibly rude and did everything they could to rush us out
we were planning to get dessert but the waitress basically through the bill at us before we had chance to order
this place is pricey and yes the food is worth it but the service makes you feel like you should be paying quater of the price
save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one
ll keep this short
amma is nothing special
the two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place
ate here week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive
will not be back
do dine at tamarind for the vegetarian dishes they are simply not up to par with the non veg selections
decor is nice though service can be spotty
this place is always packed
know because live nearby
most importantly food is excellent
try the sea bass
highly recommended
first of all dal bukhara rocks
as student in nyu need place to eat after hard day of work so usually just go to any indian restraunt near by
but ive heard lot about this for the past yrs and finally decided to eat here
am happy did the food was awsome
just awsome
and yes dal bukhara is so dam good and so are all the kababs
they are opening two more places as saw flyer there one in yonkers which is restraunt and banquet hall and another one in parsipanny new jersey
but overall give it

have been to the other locations
haru on park is simply disgusting
the fish was not fresh and the rice tasted old and stale
quite frankly this is some of the worst sushi have ever tried
will never be back
honestly the worst sushi my husband and had in our entire lives
believe us we ve been eating sushi for over yrs
not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly
the all can eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality
limited menu no so fresh ingredients thinly sliced fish fall apart rice
the only things could really taste are the very salty soy sauce lrb even its low sodium rrb the vinegar soaked rice and the scallion on top of the fish
the waitstaffs are nice though
wont come back again for sure
have been to roth twice and both times were very disappointing
once for dinner and once for brunch
both times was extremely dissappointed by the service which was boarderline rude
they wouldnt even let me finish my glass of wine before offering another
much of the time it seems like they do not care about you
the dinner was ok nothing would have again
had their eggs benedict for brunch which were the worst in my entire life tried removing the hollondaise sauce completely that was how failed it was
this was great surprise
with the theater blocks away we had delicious meal in beautiful room
the service was attentive
look forward to eating here again
planet thai is great
we love the food drinks and atmosphere
the svc can be bit rude at times esp if you have big group but overall the restaurant is must
try the pad thai it fabulous and their prices are so cheap
just because it cheap does not mean the portions are small or the food is nasty it is great
just remember the later you go the longer you may have to wait
it popular the late crowd
they forgot sandwich did include plastic forks and did include pita with the hummus platter
also the sandwiches lrb nearing rrb did come with anything like chips or side
overall not worth the money
eating in the atmosphere saves it but at your desk it very disappointing experience
love indian food and consider myself to be quite an expert on it
chennai garden is my favorite indian restaurant in the city
they have authentic indian at amazin prices
this restaurant is vegetarian there are no meat dishes whatsoever
the seats are uncomfortable if you are sitting against the wall on wooden benches
it rather cramped and busy restaurant and it closes early
patroon features nice cigar bar and has great staff
the food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate
this is nice restaurant if you are looking for good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates
not great place for family or general dining
lloovve this place
food is excellent
fish is so very fresh
waitstaff are very friendly
love yuka
mermaid inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood
the menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent
the lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with scallops and shrimp is great
the service is good and ambience is good for date or group outing
the only fallback on this restaurant is the prices
even though its good seafood the prices are too high
the lobster sandwich is and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price
went to village last night for my birthday
we picked it randomly without recommendation from someone who has been there so we were sure what to expect
we were very pleasantly surprised
the food was delicious lrb had halibut special my husband had steak rrb and the service was top notch
when my dessert came there was candle in it not because anyone asked for one but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift and said he knew it was special occassion of some sort
truly the mark of an attentive waiter
highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night
we ate at this thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods
we thought that this place is using too much of msg cooking in the foods
why
they do concern much of customer health just want to make money
please do fool us
visit new green bo when have money or when am broke
recommend the jelly fish drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings certainly the stir fry blue crab
the food is so cheap and the waiters are nice
of course it is crowded but who cares
authentic shanghai style and can not recommend better shanghai place in new york
have frequented ino for several years and the food remains excellent
cheese plate is varied delight and great bargain at
the large selection of bruschettas paninis tramezzinis keep the palate from stagnating
lrb the asparagus truffle oil parmesan bruschetta is winner rrb
wine list is extensive without being over priced
be sure to try the seasonal and always delicious specials
definitely neighborhood favorite
loved this place
almost hesititate to write review because the atmosphere was so great and would hate for it too become to crowded
the food was very good great deal and the place its self was great
the wait staff is very freindly they make it feel like you re eating in freindly little european town
like cafe noir dont get me wrong it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent
the service was terrible we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served
the waitress seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing
after dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend asked him where are you from maybe you dont know how things work in america and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on
we did tip guess the model waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager
the whole set up is truly unprofessional and wish cafe noir would get some good staff because despite the current one this is great place
pizza here is consistently good
salads are delicious way to begin the meal
you should pass on the calamari
it is thick and slightly soggy
decor is charming
service is average
what great place
came into the city to try out this restaurant because friend had recommended it to my husband
the ambience was so fun and the prices were great on top of the fact that the food was really tasty
was thrilled to have to wait on line for thirty minutes but guess that the price you pay for popular place
would definitely recommend sea if you like thai cuisine
was here few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at restaurant ever
gentleman maybe the manager came to our table and without so much as smile or greeting asked for our order
when asked about how certain dish was prepared in comparison to similar at other thai restaurants he replied this is not mcdonald every place makes things differently
while it is understandable that every place is indeed different there was not need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude
the service was poor restaurant poorly lit staff not very attentive and would have rather eaten at mcdonald than this joint
never again
absolutely loved this place
my friends spoke so much about it for months finally made the time to come down ear and dine in
excellent atmosphere delicious dishes good and friendly service
this is can became on of the ny italian food fare institutions
think that it is absolutely brilliant and well runned business operation
the wine list is also really nice
friend from seattle and went on thursday night around
everything was wonderful food drinks staff mileau
would highly recommend this place
have been to casimir over times and have always had great time there
the food is great and reasonably priced
have tried to make reservations but both times the hostess did have my name
if the weather is nice try to snag an outside table
the staff has been nice but they seemed really stressed and the unisex bathroom needs to be cleaned more often
my boyfriend and went there to celebrate my birthday the other night and all can say is that it was magnificent
from the spectacular caviar to the hospitable waitstaff felt like royalty and enjoyed every second of it
considering we were the last patrons there and it was after the closing time the waitstaff did not rush us at all and made us feel comfortable and relaxed
highly recommend caviar russe to anyone who wants delicious top grade caviar and fantastic service
nice family owned traditional restaurant
fresh ingredients and everything is made to order
was pleasantly surprised to find this gem in hoboken
friendly staff that actually lets you enjoy your meal and the company you re with
my friends and were on vacation in ny and was referred to chance by friend
found the food to be outstanding particulary the salmon dish had
also ordered the change mojito which was out of this world
my friends settled for rice dishes but we came back the following day to try the dim sum which was good not outstanding but good
we ate out in the back patio which is worth it as it cool and the music is hear well there
overall excellent restaurant
went to utsav about yr ago with my family
the food was good
the place was nice and calm
but the service was bit slow
work around the corner and tried it with colleague for the first time
the buffet had nice selection
the food was average or above including some surprising tasty dishes
service was also very good
would go back
got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries
would recommend roxy for that but not for their food
my son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge
but they were too big for the bun
consequently their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such mess that they did nt feel like finishing them
also they were each
had huge pastrami sandwich on roll
it was not really bad for pound of pastrami but it did have much taste ve had better for less elsewhere
this place is really trendi but they have forgotten about the most important part of restaurant the food
the last two times ordered from here my food was soo spicy that could barely eat it and the spice took away from the flavor of the dish
and the tom kha soup was pathetic
if you want good authentic thai this place is not the place to go
we went here for lunch couple of weeks ago on saturday and was thoroughly impressed with the food
the pesto pizza was excellent thin crust pizza with nice amount of spicy italian cheese that never heard of before
conveniently located too being right on bedford ave
the back garden sitting area is very pleasant where you can see their personal herb garden
will definetly be going back
we had the lobster sandwich and it was fantastic
my husband said he could ve eaten several more the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had
we had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful
recommend getting reservation even though we saw people seated without one
we waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right
we will be back
love the food
it the only place you can get yummy authentic japanese comfort food
it helps if you know what to order
and you ca beat the prices
highly recommended
ve lived in ny for years and this place has it all
great food good size menu great service and an unpretensious setting
the dishes offered were unique very tasty and fresh from the lamb sausages sardines with biscuits large whole shrimp to the amazing pistachio ice cream lrb the best and freshest ve ever had rrb
glad was introduced to this place and this is rare gem in ny
we have tried every thai restaurant between atlantic avenue and th streets and joya is the best
the freshest best variety and the fastest delivery
also very inexpensive
great choice at any cost and great deal
the service was excellent and the food was delicious
we are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included ceviche mix lrb special rrb crab dumplings assorted sashimi sushi and rolls two types of sake and the banana tempura
overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites but everything was delicious
definitely great spot for nice occasion or date
average to good thai food but terrible delivery
ve waited over one hour for food
they were very abrupt with me when called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice
thai restaurant out of rice during dinner
the food arrived minutes after called cold and soggy
actually feel like should keep it secret
this is wonderful place on all stand points especially value ofr money
an excellent service
went to cafe spice with of my friends on saturday night
we were greeted promptly by the waiter who was very nice and cordial
she was very helpful in suggesting us drinks and helped us in ordering lot of good dishes since we knew nothing about indian food
we were fast to order the appetizer platter since we were very hungry
the food looked very appetizing and delicious since it came on variety of fancy plates
we ended our great experience by having gulab jamun lrb dessert rrb recommended by the waiter
thanked my friend who recommended me this restaurant and will certainly recommend it to others
went here with friend on whim we went someplace else first and could get table
service here was great food was fantastic
guacamole shrimp appetizer was really great we both had the filet very good did much like the frites that came with but the filet was so good neither of us cared
will absolutely visit again
maybe tomorrow rrb
you can not go wrong with this place
the food is outstanding and the service is quick friendly and very professional
always nice crowd but never loud
go here
good for dates or with friends
am reluctant to write because would not want my jem of pizza place to become overcrowded
however it is jus too good to not praise it
by far the best pizza in manhattan
the crust is thin the ingredients are fresh and the staff is friendly
for all you lazy folks that do want to come to alphabet city say good stay out
less wait time for me
we arrived on time for our reservation and seated promptly
the menu has so many fish items and oysters
we all ordered different entrees so we could share
the fish was really really fresh
lived in maine for ten years and grew up on fish
we all agreed that mare is one of the best seafood restaurants in new york
stumbled upon this great pizzeria as explored my new neighborhood
all of the pizzas are terrific and the price is even better
highly recommend the sophia pizza
it to die for
the food was mediocre at best but it was the horrible service that made me vow never to go back
immediately after we paid the waiter took the money and said okay you guys are outta here
there are other people waiting
we were even at our table for more than an hour total
as we were leaving the couple standing by the door said to another waiter we re not in hurry
our friends have not arrived yet
so rushing us out was absolutely unnecessary
for the people who want great food plus great service roxy is place to avoid
ve been here twice now
the first time the sushi was outstanding the second time it was little bland
sure ll return for final judgement tho
the blond wood decor is very soothing the premium sake is excellent and the service is great
mizu is the japenese find in grammercy
while their kitchen food is delicious their sushi is out of this world
mizu is home to creative and unique rolls not to found anywhere else
not only is the cuisine the best around the service has always been attentive and charming
warning you may find it difficult to dine at other japanese restaurants after visit to mizu
thalia is beautiful restaurant with beautiful people serving you but the food does quite match up
ordered the smoked salmon and roe appetizer and it was off flavor
the entree was bland and small dessert was not inspired
expected quite bit more from such an expensive menu
the view is spectacular and the food is great
wonderful strawberry daiquiries as well
definitely worth the trip to battery park city
one of my favorite places in manhattan
authentic taiwanese food that cheap what more could you ask for
lrb besides that there should be more restaurants like it around the city rrb
the cold appetizer dishes taste like the way remember them to taste when was growing up in taiwan
delicious simple food in nice outdoor atmosphere
kind attentive wait staff
really like both the scallops and the mahi mahi lrb on saffron risotto yum rrb
my friend devoured her chicken and mashed potatos
delicious crab cakes too
even if the food was this good the garden is great place to sit outside and relax
great neighborhood joint
this is nice pizza place with good selection of thin crust pizza including the basil slice
their calzones are horrific bad vomit inducing yuck
they smell like they stuff them with old canned vegetables like the spinach mushroom calzone
the counter service is bad
they charge different prices all the time
they re rude at times and not very friendly
no pizza for me
anybody who likes this place must be from different planet where greasy dry and tasteless are complimentary
the dosas are skimpy unattractive and drip with grease and personally drink popcorn topping before eat another one of these
the sandwiches are dry tasteless and way overpriced
calling the place hampton chutney co does warn you that these folks offer more style than substance but in this unattractive room with unhelpful clerks there was dearth of the former too
seriously this place kicks ass
the atmosphere is unheralded the service impecible and the food magnificant
best italian food ever had lrb and being italian that means alot rrb
it is nearly impossible to get table so if you ever have the chance to go here for dinner do not pass it up
this is such lovely peaceful place to eat outside
the restaurant looks out over beautiful green lawns to the hudson river and the statue of liberty
it is set far from the small street it on and there is no traffic noise
the food is good especially their more basic dishes and the drinks are delicious
this is great place to take out of towners and perfect for watching the sunset
great sushi experience
nice value
unique apppetizers
try sushimi cucumber roll
good spreads great beverage selections and bagels really tasty
the big complaint no toasting available
complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted
murray wo do it
wo or ca is not in the service directory
but who says murray is anything about service
so close but not good enough
do be fooled by crowds of people
the service is awful
this place is not worth the prices
also do plan on asking for your favorite roll if it not on the menu you ca have it
love pizza
will be out with friends and all of sudden am hungry and only crave one thing their pizza
live in the neightborhood and am regular
it hits the spot every time
this tiny williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising
the pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in nyc
even the pasta is delicious here lrb rarity in new york pizza restaurants rrb
ve been many time and have never been disappointed
compared to ess tal offers less doughy bagel
they even scoop it out nice lrb for those on diet rrb not too much not to little
the cream cheeses are out of this world and love that coffee
little crowded but they move that line really fast
little pricey but it really hits the spot on sunday morning
bagels are ok but be sure not to make any special requests
asked for an open faced cheese sandwich and the manager basically told me to take my business elsewhere
be sure not to get anything other than bagels
the turkey burgers are scary
the worst excuse for japanese food ve ever encountered
the soup for the udon was soy sauce and water
the sushi was awful
the rice was poor quality and was cooked so badly it was hard
furthermore the rice had no seasoning so the sushi was bland and disgusting
the fish was adequate but inexpertly sliced
it is obvious that no one in the restaurant has any idea about or experience with japanese cuisine
good fast service
would highly recommend
food is great and inexpensive
the location is perfect
give it try and enjoy
thought going to jimmys would give me real domincan exprience
jimmy is dominican
well this place is so ghetto its not even funny
if you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least dollar bottle minimun then you ll love it here
would never go back there
too bad latin quarters closed
that place was awesome sally
awsome pizza especially the margheritta slice
always busy but fast moving
great atmoshere and worth every bit
open late lrb well as late as ever got there and night person rrb
winnie and her staff are the best crew you can find serving you
the food is reliable and the price is moderate
what more can you ask for
for authentic thai food look no further than toons
ive been to many thai restaurants in manhattan before and toons is by far the best thai food ive had lrb except for my mom of course rrb
try the pad thai or sample anything on the appetizer menu they re all delicious
everything about this restaurant was special
the service was attentive yet discreet
the flavors robust and subtle
the brioche and lollies as party favors is cute and sweet touch to most memorable meal
saving up for my next visit
went there in late afternoon for some bite size food and refleshment with my date
the place was quiet and delightful
service was good and food is wonderful
did not try the caviar but tried their salmon and crab salad lrb they are all good rrb
it is definitely good spot for snacks and chat
as retired hipster can say with some degree of certainty that for the last year lucky strike has been the best laid back late night in the city
the wait staff is pleasant fun and for the most part gorgeous lrb in the wonderful aesthetic beautification way not in that she way cuter than me that way rrb
the food is yummy especially their cooked to perfection mussels in spicy tomato sauce and their shoestring crispy fries
but the best part about ls is the late night atmosphere delightfully free of the bts
you can get completely delish martini in glass lrb that about drinks rrb for lrb recommend the vanilla shanty mmmm rrb in great homey setting with great music
the in house lady dj on saturday nights has outrageously good taste in music and moreover takes requests
you ca go wrong with this place
suan is great place that often take my friends lrb classmates rrb too
its location is good and the fact that hutner college is near and their prices are very reasonable makes students go back to suan again and again
love their thai
noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the must
was in love with pongsri on th but compared to suan it is slow in service and overpriced
will go back to suan soon
in summer eat outside on terrace lrb another great feature of suan rrb
can not imagine friendlier staff working in restaurant
can not imagine better indian food in all of the city
can not imagine you not rushing out to eat there
this restaurant used to be our regular thursday night dinner location
during the course of the past months the chef and staff changed and it was not for the better
wish they would change back to what it was before
the food now is inconsistent
this is the kind of place you like to take all your friends to and still keep secret
the setting is casual and romantic
prices are very good
the food is excellent
if you re daring try the balsamic vinegar over icecream it wonderful
do not get the go go hamburgers no matter what the reviews say
they were such rip off lrb for four small meat patties in steamed buns rrb and not worth trying
the rest of the dim sum though pricey by chinatown standards is worth it
steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table
the wait here is long for dim sum but if you do like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig this is sleek lrb for chinatown rrb alternative
few tips skip the turnip cake roast pork buns and egg custards
these are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner
lrb rrb turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of mott st just south of bayard
lrb rrb egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of mott street just south of canal
after passing by this restaurant for sometime finally decided to go in and have dinner
was pleasantly suprised
the food was exceptional
the menu consisted of standard brassiere food better then places like balthazar etc
choose to go with one of the special the braised lamb shank in red wine which was excellent
the service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual
the restaurant is bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy great meal
this little place has cute interior decor and affordable city prices
the pad se ew chicken was delicious however the pad thai was far too oily
would just ask for no oil next time
have eaten at ginger house several times and it always good
the fried dumplings are great
finally reliable chinese restaurant
this place would be so much better served by being run by group that actually understands customer service
the only thing you can do here is walk in and eat but planning an event especially small intimate one forget about it
they are not helpful in the least and will give you the grand run around so by the time the event date rolls around you will not only regret chosing this place but also become hostile
nobody at this restaurant will give firm answers about anything and in the end not one person takes responsibility for anything
terrible terrible management deserves to be shut down
never fails to please
delicious bagels especially when right out of the oven
spreads and toppings are great though bit pricey
service is fast and friendly
only drawback they wo toast your bagel and they do make eggs for the bagel
but that is highly forgivable
been there done that and new york it not that big deal
the food is decent at best and the ambience well it matter of opinion some may consider it to be sweet thing thought it was just annoying
if celebrities make you sweat then your in for ride but if your like most around these parts then you ll just yawn and wonder whats with all the hype
rao is good restaurant but it nothing special
ve eaten at many different indian restaurants
but after last night spice grill is the only place eating indian cuisine
you must try the shrimp appetizers
even my indian friend could believe how good and tasty everything was
this place has the the correct ambience and an excellent staff to make you feel like guest and friend at the same time
great food great prices great service
if you are looking for good quality cheap eats this is the place
it perfect place to have amanzing indian food
really loved the different and inovated touch that the cheff gives to the food
also it great to have dinner in very romantic and confortable place the service it just perfect they re so frendly that we never want to live the place
love ess bagel but live on the west side so often go to murray for convenience
their bagels are fine but they are little overcooked and not really special bagel experience
better than the bagel shop on the corner but not worth going out of your way for in my opinion
also little more expensive than your average bagel place
great bagels made the old fashioned way
the appetizing is excellent just as good as zabars barney greengrass at reasonable price lrb if bought by the pound rrb
drawbacks service is slow and they do toast
the food was absolutely amazing
the baked clams octopus we shared as appetizers were the best we ve ever had
the lamb was tender so full of flavor the dessert was divine
the waiter was attentive
the place itself is beautiful the bar scene seems to be happening
downtown dinner prixe fix appetizers were ok waiter gave me poor suggestion try the potato stuff kanish best one
small servings for main entree had salmon lrb wasnt impressed rrb girlfriend had chicken it was good
dessert is joke dont bother
volare virgins or weekly regulars everyone gets treated the same and you ca ask for more than that when the service is this friendly
the restaurant has family feel not least with regard to the portions which are enormous the veal alone could have single handedly solved third world famine
the anti pasta was excellent especially the calamari as were the filling pasta mains
the wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal
still any quibbles about the bill were off set by the pour your own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house
fantastic place
cute and decorative
pleasant surprise
go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else
lucky strike is great casual place to just grab bite to eat
yeah the crowd can take it bit seriously but it should
great food great decor great service
recommend it
just ignore the trendy wannabes
this is the perfect spot for meeting friends having lunch dinner pre theatre or after theatre drinks
lrb always ask the bartender for the seasonal beer
guaranteed to be tasty experience rrb
excellent spot for holiday get togethers with co workers or friends that you have seen in while
have been doing all of the above at the heartland brewery for over years now and have never been disappointed
all the people that bring there go back on their own and bring their friends
go there once and oh yes you will go back you will
what great place
not the typical nyc gimmick theme restaurant
cool bar with great food and tons of excellent beer
and even with it pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too
loved it
out of the hundreds of italian restaurants in queens this is among the best
the shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful
it is expensive but well worth the money
if you venture off the island of manhattan and ca seem to find great italian restaurant drive to corona
the only thing more wonderful than the food lrb which is exceptional rrb is the service
the only thing the waiters do do for you is wipe your chin when you leave
wonderful at holiday time
cozy romantic atomosphere with only around tables at most
service was very prompt but slightly rushed
food was very good but not what would consider out of this world
go here for romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience
my friend from milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian
too bad the food was of the same heritage
the porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless so was the seafood tagliatelle
real dissapointment
but that was the icing on the cake tiramisu that resembled nothing have ever had
they should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips good but far cry from what the name implies
priced at upper intermediate range
really liked this place
everything had was good and eater
it was pretty inexpensive too
this place has the best chinese style bbq ribs in the city
also recommend the rice dishes or the different varieties of congee lrb rice porridge rrb
it great to go for quick lunch either alone or with friend
it definately not place to go if you want to impress someone
however if you want great food at great price and do mind the decor you ca beat this place
quick and friendly service
this is one of the best comfort food places in the city
it somewhere you can eat and be happy
when feeling stressed by the noise and congestion around my office head for cafe st bart
when you re sitting in their main dining room lrb which has spectacular hand painted high ceiling rrb you never know there was world outside
the food is wonderful tasty and filling and the service is professional and friendly
ca wait for summer when they serve outside on their gigantic patio
ahhh
recently tried suan and thought that it was great
this little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get lot of food for your money
the service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals
have to say that am pleasantly suprised and will most likely stop in again if am in the neighborhood
they all know you
good food
good drink
how do you rate home
have never had cheescake like this
thought had died and gone to heaven
great spot whether looking for couple of drinks or quiet dinner
warm and friendly in the winter and terrific outdoor seating in the warmer months
the food is great and they have good selecion of wines at reasonable prices
have been several times and it never dissapoints
after hearing lot of great things about the restaurant and passing by it on daily basis we decided to try
we were less than impressed
while the ambiance and atmosphere were great the food and service could have been lot better
we ordered the chicken casserole but what we got were few small pieces of chicken all dark meat and on the bone
probably would not go again
ve been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine if not good
stick with the chicken beef and lamb dishes
do usually order wine with indian so ca comment on their wine list or their wines
instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian
service is friendly and never had problem walking in and getting table
would recommend reservations on weekends though
skip dessert
best reuben sandwich ever
classic
do miss bloom on your next trip to manhatten
it was the first place we ate on our first trip to new york and it will be the last place we stop as we head out of town on our next trip to new york
thanks bloom for lovely trip
as fan of thai have tried quite few different restaurants in nyc and this one was definitely the worst
the food was not fresh the sauces were bland and very oily
it just was thai
went to ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza lrb as love la pizza fresca rrb
was surprisingly disappointed
pizza was little soggy
ravioli was good but have to say that found everything bit overpriced
not enough wines by the glass either
service however was excellent and liked the setting atmosphere lot
food was just average if they lowered the prices just bit it would be bigger draw
this place is great bargain
authentic pakistani food
people are always friendly
do waste money on decor
just straight up cheap good food
faan is sooo good
the best pad thai ve ever had
the design and atmosphere is just as good
bottles of wine are cheap and good
what more could you want
the food was actually aweful
not picky but it was actually gross
the mussles were the fishiest things ve ever tasted the seabass was bland the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese the penne chicken had bones in it it was disgusting
nice atmosphere the service was very pleasant and the desert was good
would recomend it for dinner
this is the perfect date spot for williamsburg couples
the jukebox plays everything from italian opera to the strokes
the food is amazing rich pastas and fresh doughy pizza
best of all is the warm vibe the owner is super friendly and service is fast
if only they delivered they make mint
go here for the drinks
especially during happy hour
enough said
the drinks are amazing and half off till pm
ask for usha the nicest bartender in manhattan
my fav was the sassy lassi
this is an amazing place to try some roti rolls
really recommend the very simple unda lrb egg rrb rolls
delicate spices onions eggs and kick ass roti
amazing
toons has recently been redone so it now very attractive space
the food as good as ever
in an area sadly lacking in decent thai food this is one of the best spots
went here last night nice decor good service but the food was surprisingly excellent
the portions are huge so it might be good to order three things to split lrb rather than one appetizer and entree per person rrb for two people
among all of the new th avenue restaurants this offers by far one of the best values for your money
ca wait to go back
best drumsticks over rice and sour spicy soup in town
beef noodle soup is good as well
the service is good and the resturant is clean
best taiwanese food in ny
have been to rao probably times the past years and it keeps getting better
for those that go once and do enjoy it all can say is that they just do get it
rao has the best service and atmosphere in nyc
good luck getting table
my roommate and love this place
we recently decided to try this location and to our delight they have outdoor seating perfect since had my yorkie with me
indoor was very cozy and cute
the portion sizes here are huge and the sushi is good
while it not nobu it sure is great deal and you definitely will leave feeling satisfied and full
staff is very accomodating
excellent dumplings served amid clean chic decor
got the piece dim sum combo every bite of which was great
but for each small piece
not worth it
wo go back unless someone else is footing the bill
came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by friend
the decor is very simple but comfortable
the food was delicious but do not come here on empty stomach
the portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that
you must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert
the staff there is very attentive and down to earth
loved it and would go again
great indian food and the service is incredible
the owner truly caters to all your needs
when family came in he gave them apps to test their palets and then ordered for them
everyone was more then happy with his choices
great food and the prices are very reasonable
obviously the chinese translation of this place does not mean big wong it actually means great prosperity
the food here does great service to the name lrb cantonese that is rrb
fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of bbq roast pork
this dish is my favorite and always get it when go there and never get tired of it
try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call ow ley soh delicious and sweet tasting bread
simply some good tasting chinese food at incredible prices
service is not what you are coming here for
just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that all the service need
big wong is great place to eat and fill your stomach
this place we stumbled upon it on labor day weekend
whoever the jazz duo was they were on point
good music great food speedy service affordable prices
even the wine by the glass was good
its little out of the way if you do live in the neighborhood but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are
consistently good japanese tapas
same owner as the guy who owns typhoon which is just down the street on st marks and st ave
always good drinks and service is pretty good
atmosphere is nice and relaxed too
great place to meet up for some food and drinks
yakitori lrb bbq meats rrb is tasty too
it also attached to angel share which is cool more romantic bar
just moved to the neighborhood and we ve been trying all the west village sushi restaurants
if you do mind pre sliced low quality fish unfriendly staff and sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place
price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making return visit
was going to share but feel obligated while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop piece of unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing
no thanks
this place which is only few months old is perhaps queens biggest secret
fabulous decor makes you feel like you re in trendy manhattan restaurant very very good food cheaply priced generally friendly staff and if you re manhattanite or spend most of your time in manhattan rice avenue will make you feel at home very soho village upper west side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele all on roosevelt avenue
we were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date
we were then shooed inside
one would think we get an apology or complimentary drinks instead we got snobby waiter would even take our order for minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so
we left never to return
with so many good restaurants on the uws do need overpriced food absurdly arrogant wait staff who do recognize they work at glorified diner clumsy service and management that does care
am relatively new to the area and tried pick bgel on nd and was disappointed with the service and thought the food was overated and on the pricey side
if you are in the area try the bagel shoppe on th street which is blocks away on nd ave
great bagels spreads and good place to hang out in
you fellas above says its the best taiwanese restaurant in town
however it is the only taiwanese restaurant in town
the food is okay and the prices here are mediocre
you ca say its cheap because food is cheaper in chinatown
they re are better taiwanese restaurants and they are located in flushing queens
baluchi has solid food and nice decor at reasonable prices
the only problem is that the manager is complete incompetent
he offers subpar service and has no personality
in fact it appears he is going to go postal at any moment
skip this location and go to the one in soho
there is no excuse for such lousy service
have never before eaten pieces of relatively good nigiri
stuffing yourself with japanese food is rare thing
you can do it here
for all you can eat sushi can not be beaten
went to areo on sunday afternoon with four of my girlfriends and spent three enjoyable hours there
the restaurant was packed at first so we waited at the bar for about minutes before we were seated
most of the servers are very attentive friendly and quite attractive
the atmosphere was mostly of an older crowd but there were few groups of mid year olds also
the vibe is very relaxed and cozy service was great and the food was excellent
me and my girls will definitely go back
food was good and the view of the new york city skiline was terrific even on foggy rainy day like that of when went
would highly recommand requesting table by the window
although they do the typical what kind of water would you like questions the service was good and overall very relaxing to place to eat
ve eaten at pizza gruppo few times but more often order delivery
the food is great
personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights
heartily recommend
there is downside if you re ordering in the delivery guys have major attitude
never have had such dramatic delivery guys lrb lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath live in walkup rrb who always seem disappointed with their tips
hey think for block walk ai bad
love the scene first off the place has character and nice light to it very fortunate location wise
the pizza was pretty good and huge
the price very reasonable
we were and got the family size penne la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion bucket of food literally
we got most of it back at home with us
would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that ca not mention or undermine
the pasta penne was pretty extra buttery creamy which means big task to diggest tasty at first but would say that was full with slice of pizza and to count penne got little moody afterwards cause was stuffed lol
no really
have eaten lot of pizza here
la rosa waltzes in and think they are doing it the best
interesting selection good wines service fine fun decor
have been twice to this restaurant
love it
plan on stopping by next week as well
found it on cold night the perfect spot to warm up
recieved prompt service with smile
to me it exemplifies soho cute artsy interesting
definately check it out
this place blew me away by far my new favorite restaurant on the uppereast side
the wine list is extensive and impressive
love the atmosphere felt like was in paris
the mussels were fantastic and so was the dessert definitely going to be back very soon
just read mocaramel review and felt compelled to respond
have been coming here for years and have nothing but good things to say about the service and the great staff at la lanterna
over the years the host vittorio and his crew have always treated me as family although with all the business this not so little gem does it amazing he even able to remember consistent but not so frequent visitor
ve also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years new jazz bar the most fantastic dining garden the best thin crust pizzas and now lasagna menu which is to die for lrb these are not your average lasagnas rrb
love this place
keep up the good work guys
my girlfiends and ate at again last night
have to say have never had disapointing meal here
we could have made meal of the yummy dumplings from the dumpling menu
luckily we saved room for the bbq salmon sea bass and crispy duck
we got little tipsy from the sake but is that what saturday nights with the girlfriends are all about
love al di la
recommend this place to everyone
great food
one of my favorite places in brooklyn
the pastas are incredible the risottos lrb particularly the sepia rrb are fantastic and the braised rabbit is amazing
overpriced and not tasty
the food here was mediocre at best
it was totally overpriced fish and chips was about
there are so many other great places to go to eat and drink this place is not worth it
tasty dog
an awesome organic dog and conscious eco friendly establishment
one of the best hot dogs have ever eaten
ca wait to go back
the cypriot restaurant has lot going for it
but the best pork souvlaki ever had is the main thing
trust me
run do walk
super yummy pizza
was visiting new york city with friend and we discovered this really warm and inviting restaurant
looove their eggplant pizza as well as their pastas
we had half half pizza mine was eggplant and my friend had the buffalo and it was sooo huge for small size pizza
we had fun eating in there we were there like around in the morning
will comeback for sure wish they have it here in la
excellent food although the interior could use some help
the space kind of feels like an alice in wonderland setting without it trying to be that
paid just about for good meal though rrb
great sake
reliable fresh sushi
my husband and take out from here times month
the sashimi is always fresh and the rolls are innovative and delicious
have never had problem with service save missing rice once
delivery can be spot on or lacking depending on the weather and the day of the week
delivery guy sometimes get upset if you do tip more than
we ve found it to be better and fresher than kiku which is comparable in price
best sushi ever
this place has ruined me for neighborhood sushi
creative consistent fresh
excellent sashimi and the millennium roll is beyond delicious
not cheap but very yummy
love it
very very nice
the place is bit hidden away but once you get there it all worth it
not only is the food
loved it
my wife and went to water edge for romantic dinner
we had very nice time
the waiter was attentive the food was delicious and the views of the city were great
definitely go back again
great place to relax and enjoy your dinner
there is something about their atmosphere that makes me come back nearly every week
place is open till late no dress code
good food my favorite is the seafood spaghetti
highly recommended
excellent food for great prices
my husband and have been sold on this from the first visit
the wait staff is very courteous and accomodating
the space is limited so be prepared to wait up to minutes hour but be richly rewarded when you savor the delicious indo chinese food
there are no negatives to speak of
the bestt
my favorite place lol
love their chicken pasta cant remember the name but is sooo good
its alright
im not necessarily fanatical about this place but it was fun time for low pirces
lobster was good nothing spectacular
its just fun place to go not five star restaraunt
way below average
think the pizza is so overrated and was under cooked
had no flavor and the staff is rude and not attentive
would never go back
love this place
was here for the pizza so ca comment on that yet but what had was very good
the service was quick and friendly
everyone was smiling so that made me feel welcome
thought the restaurant was nice and clean
ordered the vitello alla marsala and was pretty impressed
the veal and the mushrooms were cooked perfectly
the potato balls were not dry at all in fact it was buttery
the only downside they only take cash which is ok if you know about it ahead of time
ll be back for sure
worst place on smith street in brooklyn
very immature bartender didnt know how to make specific drinks service was so slowwwww the food was not fresh or warm waitresses were busy flirting with men at the bar and werent very attentive to all the customers
would never recommend this place to anybody even for casual dinner
awesome
the food is always fresh
overpriced japanese food with mediocre service
went here on sat and was disappointed
chicken teriyaki had tomato or pimentos on top
food was luke warm
the waitress was not attentive at all
was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they dont have
too many other good places to have to settle
not because you are the four seasons you are allowed to charge an arm and leg for romatic dinner
the food was excellent as well as service however left the four seasons very dissappointed
do not think dinner in manhattan should cost where am not swept off my feet
red dragon roll my favorite thing to eat of any food group hands down
just go to yamato and order the red dragon roll
if you do like it do know what to tell you
the seafood dynamite is also otherworldly
not even going to bother to describe it it speaks for itself
favorite sushi in nyc
have eaten at some of the best sushi joints in nyc lrb nobu bond street jewelbako etc rrb and yamato is my favorite
an unpretentious spot in park slope the sushi is consistently good the service is pleasant effective and unassuming
in the summer months the back garden area is really nice
the rolls are creative and have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food
the dancing white river and millenium rolls are musts
so good
can eat here every day of the week really lol love this place rrb
gross food wow
ca remember the last time had such gross food in new york
my quesadilla tasted like it had been made by three year old with no sense of proportion or flavor
and for plate of bland guacamole
come on
do get me started on the margaritas either
mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila
really find it rather scandalous that such crappy restaurant attracts such crowds this in the city of million restaurants at least of which are way better than this one
save your money and your time and go somewhere else
oh and never write reviews just was so moved by how bad this place was felt it was my duty to spread the word
great indian food
this place was reccomended to me by friend
when got there the place was packed but they made sure to seat me quickly
the food was good the place was clean and affordable
noticed alot of indian people eatting there which is great sign for an indian place
this is one of my favorite spot very relaxing the food is great all the times celebrated my engagement and my wedding here it was very well organized
the staff is very good
love their drink menu
highly recommend this beautiful place
nice for one time special occasion
went for mom birthday brunch lunch
they honored reservation on sunday afternoon very well
be aware
we were offered water for the table but were not told the voss bottles of water were piece
food was ok
nice view of river and nyc
come here enjoy very much with husband
remind me of home
great survice
mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm so delicious
beautifully designed dreamy egyptian restaurant that gets sceney at night
watch the talented belly dancers as you enjoy delicious baba ganoush that more lemony than smoky
oh and there hookah
raymond the bartender rocks
pacifico is great place to casually hang out
the drinks are great especially when made by raymond
the omlette for brunch is great
the spinach is fresh definately not frozen
quacamole at pacifico is yummy as are the wings with chimmichuri
weakness is the chicken in the salads
it just average just shredded no seasoning on it
also personally was fan of the portobello and asparagus mole
overall decent food at good price with friendly people
best indian restaurant in the city
decor needs to be upgraded but the food is amazing
this small astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in new york
small bright and clean bz grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints both in astoria and out
what really makes it shine is the food which is aggressively seasoned with cyrpriot spices and all made in house lrb even the gyro meat and sausages rrb and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected
all the various greek and cypriot dishes are excellent but the gyro is the reason to come if you do eat one your trip was wasted
best restaurant in brooklyn
the best
great food amazing service this place is class act
the veal was incredible last night
fresh mind blowing flavors
this place is must visit
you want to have real hot dog in brooklyn
skip nathan you can get that at the mall go to bark
delicious creative and fun
got date go here
every time have special occasion with my boyfriend have hard time going anywhere else
it is so romantic
its dark and cozy there is always jazz music playing when we go
most of the booths allow you to sit next to eachother without looking like that couple
the food is all shared so we get to order together and eat together
ve enjoyed of the dishes we ve ordered with the only exceptions being the occasional too authentic for me dish lrb daring eater but not that daring rrb
once you try it for special occasion beware you ca stop
you ll be ther for every anniversary birthday valentines day
for fabulous wedding
my daughter wedding reception at water edge received the highest compliments from our guests
everyone raved about the atmosphere lrb elegant rooms and absolutely incomparable views rrb and the fabulous food
service was wonderful
everyone was cheerfully cooperative and helpful
paul the maitre was totally professional and always on top of things
thank you everyone at water edge
ruth mother of the bride
would not go back
service ok but unfriendly filthy bathroom
the high prices you re going to pay is for the view not for the food
the bar drinks were eh ok to say the least
the stuff tilapia was horrid tasted like cardboard
we thought the dessert would be better wrong
down the toilet
oh speaking of bathroom the mens bathroom was disgusting
the floor was wet the trash can filled with hand towels all over the floor no soap and no hand towels left
go to son cubano in edgewater nj instead
good experience
during our trip to nyc we made reservations to dine in the pool room of the four seasons for their pre theater menu lrb offering modified menu for pp rrb
the wine list was extensive though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings
the bread we received was horrible rock hard and cold and the free appetizer of olives was disappointing
however our main course was wonderful
had fish and my husband had the filet both of which exceeded our expectations
the dessert lrb we had pear torte rrb was good but once again the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions
when we inquired about ports the waitress listed off several but did not know taste variations or cost
not what would expect for the price and prestige of this location
all in all would return as it was beautiful restaurant but hope the staff pays more attention to the little details in the future
short and sweet seating is great it romantic cozy and private
the boths are not as small as some of the reviews make them out to look they re perfect for people
the service was extremely fast and attentive lrb thanks to the service button on your table rrb but barely understood word when the waiter took our order
the food was ok and fair nothing to go crazy
over
over all the looks of the place exceeds the actual meals
so what you really end up paying for is the restaurant not the food
will probably not return but it is great dinning experience to try atleast once
impressed
subtle food and service
noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food enjoy
servers are all different greg is my favorite
sometimes tables do understand his sense of humor but it refreshing to have server who has personality professionalism and respects the privacy of your dinner
this is the first place ve been that runner remembers my order hope he likes his job because have half mind to steal him for my restaurant
prices are fair across the board for both food and bev
go out to eat and like my courses servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink
restaurants in manhattan should try to model food and service after this place
amazing fresh dogs but best of all endless toppings
this place had all the trimmings and mean all
peppers onions relish chilli cheeses you name it
amazing fun for hot dog lovers of all ages please do yourself favor and check this place out
best dining experience in the west village
stepping into casa la femme last night was true experience unlike any other in new york
highly impressed from the decor to the food to the hospitality to the great night had
the have great cocktail with citrus vodka and lemon and lime juice and mint leaves that is to die for
food took some time to prepare all worth waiting for
we were drawn into the belly dancing show that captivated the crowd
never write on these sites but this restaurant is def worth commending
great find in the west village
maggot in the food
ve been wanting to go to this place forever and finally got table
the menu looked great and the waiter was very nice but when the food came it was average
nevertheless finished my plate and that when found maggot in mushroom sauce at the bottom
showed it to the manager and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts lrb but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for rrb
when the bill came nothing was comped so told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine but did think should have to pay for food with maggot in it
yes ate the food but certainly would not have if had seen the maggot before eating and was at this point fairly sick to my stomach
the manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine lrb which cost less than the food rrb and made it seem like big concession
we paid and left because we did feel like arguing any more
have worked in restaurants and cook lot and there is no way maggot should be able to get into well prepared food
for restaurant with such good reputation and that is usually so packed there was no reason for such lack of intelligent customer service
fairly late entry into the haute barnyard sweepstakes flatbush farm is in the same league as the blue hills or even the farm on adderlys of the world but it pretty good albeit with somewhat dismal setting
unhygienic
do not recommend
went there times
got hair in my food times of then
great place great value
the food is flavorful plentiful and reasonably priced
the atmosphere is relaxed and casual
it great place to order from or sit in
awesome
inexpensive unassuming great time
sushi experience was unbelievable with my fiance
try it
very pleased
good creative rolls
yamato is an excellent place to go if youre not into sashimi or if you have friends who doesnt like sushi much
they have great rolls the triple color and norwegetan rolls are awesome and filling
one special roll and one regular roll is enough to fill you up but save room for dessert
they have delicious banana chocolate dessert as well as great green tea tempura
the appetizers are also delicious
amazing food
mazing interior
great food
ve had my fair share of modern japanese and this spot delivers
the atmosphere was pretty nice but had bit lacking which it tries to make up for with crazy scheme of mirrors
if you re into being lost when you re just five feet from your table then hey that good thing
despite the confusing mirrors this will likely be my go to for modern japanese food for the foreseeable future
another review here claimed the pre fix was per person including sake but it is per person not including sake
indo chinese food pretty good
not very fancy place but very good chinese style indian food
the chicken lollipop is my favorite most of the dishes lrb have to agree with previous reviewer rrb are quite oily and very spicy espeically the chilli chicken
my mom originally introduced me to this place but even she lrb being indian rrb feels the food can be somewhat over the top spicy and far too oily
still we keep going back rrb
was speechless by the horrible food
attended holiday dinner at the restaurant and the food was majorly disappointing
rather than eating the meat entree being offered requested vegetarian dish
rather than preparing vegetarian dish the chef presented me with plate of steamed vegetables lrb minus sauce seasoning or any form or aesthetic presentation rrb
was so stunned and left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing
this place survives on reputation alone
will never return
best in all of nyc
this is the most wonderful restaurant in all of new york city not just brooklyn
for years they have put out the most tasty most delicious food and kept it that way
never swaying never bad meal never bad service
telling you
you should travel from the bronx to try it
great food great wine list great service in great neighborhood
so delicious
patsy pizza true love
hands down the best pizza on the planet
my bf and go to the walk up counter and order pie
in about minutes the thing is gone
need say more
great hot dogs
the hot dogs were juicy and tender inside and had plenty of crunch and snap on the outside
great toppings definitely place you need to check out for late night munchies or mid day boost
great taste
great original taste
for me dishes little oily but overall dining experience good
helpful service and average price per dish
the only thing that strikes you is the decor lrb not very pleasant rrb
great food
this place has great indian chinese food
the flavors are amazing and the value is phenomenal
be prepared to wait because the place is pretty tiny
also they do not take credit card so come with cash
even though the place is not beautiful the food speaks for itself
best indian chinese in the city by far
amazing my favorite
have been living in nyc for bit now and have to say love to go out and explore the scene
came across village underground by accident now go there all the time
the martinis are amazing and very fairly priced
the service is amazing ve had different waiters and they were all nice which is rare thing in nyc
the dj is awesome have been there for my birthday and bunch of other times with friends and keep going back
you can get table without reservation if you get there early they do make you by bottles
which lets face it at times it good thing
in the end you end up with fair tab and nothing but great time
highly recommended
one of the best if not the best restaurants in park slope lrb and ny in general rrb
everything on the menu is great
this establishment is the real deal
wish ny had more of these kind of places intimate superb food homey top notch all the way around certainly worth the wait
there is expensive but worth it and there is expensive and wtf
this is twenty something guy that does mind laying down for fine and delicious meal for on special occassions
but for dinner for two that did include wine
are you freaking kidding me
look the appetizers were really good
the entree was also very good
ca argue about that but they are clearly over priced
what you are paying for is the environment and the name
yes the place is classy and beautiful but they most certainly target the uber whealthy not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in while
included
drinks glasses of dom perignon at each
starters kobe beef sashimi
which of course is not real kobe but wagyu beef
surprised that place of this caliber would advertise it as kobe
beef consomme
entrees vanison steak and bison steak
vanison was good but not amazing
bison was quite excellent however
dessert pure disaster
just not good at all
some pineapple covered in glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing not impressive at all
read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and thought to myself but may be it is worth it
was wrong
the four seasons has history and it is sort of landmark of new york city restaurants but trust me they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say ve been to the four seasons restaurant
wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly curiousity got the best of me and paid dearly for it
all in all the food was great lrb except for the dessserts rrb
the environment is very upscale and you will see lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts
if you are going for the food it will not be worth it
yes it is good but ve had better for cheaper
you would think they would make up for it with service sadly no
service was just ok it is not what you expect for
terrible waste of money scammers
agree that dining at casa la femme is like no other dining experience
but not in good way
am actually offended to have spent so much money on such bad experience
literally just got back home after visiting casa la femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time
we went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different
our visit their to say the least was an unpleasant and costly experience
and even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience
we did arrive late for our reservation so can not complain too much about the wait for table
although we were told minutes and it was more like minutes
we were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited
the place is beautiful
the hostess was very pleasant
however our drinks were were horrible
once we finally got table despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into table that was only price fixed
since we were already waiting so long we felt we had no other choice but to accept it
our experience did not ever get any better
for each course we waited over hour to minutes and were never offered drink
we also asked for hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the hooka
after the th time asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner
we asked for beverages and never received them
we asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order
my chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which had to keep spitting out into my napkin
would not expect this for dinner
by the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage nor hooka
what we did do was waste hours being trapped in table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka some of which we never received
the only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses
to top it all off the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant
by the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs and we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers
if it seemed possible to do so while there would have fought my bill since my dinner portion of my meal was inedible
have never left restaurant feeling as if was abused and wasted my hard earned money
my husbands birthday and my sons was not as it was intended and we drove two hours to spend too much money to be treated terribly
wish could be refunded
do go with larger group than
went here for family birthday dinner
five of us walked in at approximately on thursday evening
the hostess said wow that large group unless you are together to which replied no we are and there will be one more so table for six please
at first we were little taken aback as this seemed to present problem although the restaurant looked fairly empty but they hastily put the table together for us
the menu is fairly simple without much descriptions
there was no tap beer that evening which was disappointment
not much of selection of bottled beer either we went with brahma
the appetizers we ordered were served quickly an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but tiny portion lrb maybe of each rrb
the lobster knuckles lrb special of the day rrb were ok but pretty tasteless
believe there were shrimp in the salt encrusted shrimp appetizer
after we ate our appetizers lrb which took all of minutes rrb we ordered another round of brahma and tried to stall little as we waited for our sixth dinner member
the waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order
we replied that we would like to wait more minutes if that was okay
she replied well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now since you are larger party and it might get crowded
we called the other person who was very close by and she told us to order for her so we did
the food arrived in about minutes
had the thai style fried sea bass which was very good
everyone seemed generally happy with their food except my brother who had the grilled mahi mahi seemingly drenched in grapfruit juice
heard the lobster roll was excellent
they seemed to continue to rush us along taking plates without asking if we were done lrb my sister still had her fork in hand rrb
all in all the food was good little on the expensive side but fresh
service not the friendliest to our large party
probably would not go back here
great indian food
lived on th st and wanted indian one day so decided to check this place out
food was amazing love indian food and eat it quite regularly but can say this is one of the best ve had
very normal indian food but done really well
have it instead of because of the price lrb just chicken tikka masala no bread of rice is rrb which would expect at upscale indian restaurant but this place does have an upscale feel
also waiters try to push more food on you like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost
do appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron knowledge so that was huge turnoff lrb more than the price rrb
but if you re prepared to spend some and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary then this is the place to go for indian food
one of the best
bukhara grill the tagline says it all indian spice rave
my gf and dine at bukhara often as she lives near it
the lunch buffet is expensive but is deff worth it
we go often for lunch and the place is packed
we have gone for dinner only few times but the same great quality and service is given
bukhara is on my top indian places in nyc
wretched and retching
this will be only the third online review have ever made about restaurant in my life
they have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant
have never been so disgusted by both food an service
for starters they delivered us someone else order
fine wont hang you for that
however once received my predictably mediocre order of what dokebi thinks passes as korean fair lrb sometimes you have to settle when it your only option rrb got through about half my kimchee before found piece of random lettuce accompanied by far more disgusting slimy clearly bad piece of fish skin
not one to jump to complaints lrb hence my lack of previous online reviewing rrb called the restaurant to give them heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations
my main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others but would be lying is said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen was expecting at least minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation
none was made so hung up
less than three minutes passed before found myself doubled over the toilet
my girlfriend being slightly more aggressive and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal called back only to be informed that was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant
not only have worked in restaurants for many years am now in culinary school am huge lover of oysters and fish and my girlfriend is half korean
we know the difference between and oyster and bad fish
it was as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand but now it simply repulsive
eat at your own risk
gorgeous place ideal for romantic dinner
took my boyfriend for dinner on saturday night
book gorgeous white organza tent which included four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed lot
the service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing
completely recommend casa la femme for any special occasion and to really impress your date
more williamsburg garbage
my wife and visited dokebi tonight
we ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgi bokum
the dishes came out around minutes apart
the bibimbap was average but the stone bowl was even close to sizzling
too bad had paid an extra for the stone bowl
the nakgi bokum was horrible
easily the worst stir fried squid ve ever tasted
the sauce tasted more like chinese fast food than decent korean
the side dishes were passable and did get refill upon request
the real problem had with this place was the complete lack of service
mentioned the squid dish was very good when the waitress visited
she just nodded and walked off
there were no communications issues either as she spoke perfect english
as to my comment about the food no apology or acknowledgment was made
my wife had barely touched that mess of dish
we were charged full price
if you ware looking for korean fusion suggest you try some of the places in the east village
authentic korean food lovers should visit nd street of course
lives up to the hype
we ve lived around the corner from this place for over year and finally had dinner there
we ve tried before but it always packed and does take reservations
it was well worth the wait
the wife had the risotto which was amazing
it does look appetizing as it covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black but the taste was phenomenal
the farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty
love margherita pizza looove east village pizza
love this place every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go
quintessential slice of nyc pizza
the crust has great bite and good chew the sauce is light with nice acidity to it the salt from the cheese is great really heightens the flavor of all the other components
personally like the margherita pizza better but they are all good
possibly the most romantic restaurant in the city
this is undoubtedly my favorite modern japanese brasserie lrb that do serve sushi rrb and in my opinion one of the most romantic restaurants in the city
not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot once you enter the unmarked wooden doors the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you re no longer in the city
if you re planning to come here make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching lrb choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky rrb
it just you and your date and an occasional cute excuse me before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth
my party had the bbe fixe prix menu which was such wonderful deal since it also came with flight of sake
never used to be fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it lot more and am acquiring better taste of it
we started off with delightful sashimi amuse bouche
our first course was tuna sashimi with green yuzu sauce
picked the grilled black cod as my entree which absolutely devoured while someone commented that the grilled salmon dish was better
the entrees were served with miso soup and rice
the sake complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world
for desserts we tried the frozen black sesame mousse lrb interesting but not extraordinary rrb and matcha lrb powdered green tea rrb and blueberry cheesecake which was phenomenal
maybe it was the great company lrb had friends visiting from philly yes it was not date this time rrb or the super reasonable price point but just ca say enough good things about this brasserie
do usually visit the same establishment more than once what more twice but ll come to zenkichi anytime for quiet unhurried and memorable dinner
terrible would be compliment
the service leaves much to be desired from feeling like you are rushed the place your order to being ignored the rest of the night
we were people celebrtating birthday we sat in the tent
we paid fixed pricce but got nothing
we never ate because by close to in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating
they are extremely rude not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us bill well over for some drinks adn their pita bread
stay away
great shabu shabu
go here at least once every other week particularly when it cold
love it
to be honest we only ever eat the shabu shabu
tried couple other dishes but was too impressed
but for the shabu shabu you wo find much better in ny
in fact there is only one ve tried that even compares lrb shabu tatsu rrb and even then prefer dokebi
the meat is fresh the sauces are great you get kimchi and salad free with your meal and service is good too
dokebi gives williamsburg the right one two punch of classic korean food and fusion twists like pork belly tacos
the hot dogs are good yes but the reason to get over here is the fantastic pork croquette sandwich perfect on its supermarket squishy bun
restaurant with view
celebrated my fathers birthday here
the food tasted very good
the family seafood entree was very good
the main entree was also very good
we order bit of everything on the menu
price is high but the food is good so would come back again
this place does make any sense
just want to warn you all do waste your time and money
this place has totally weird decor stairs going up with mirrored walls am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional
this place is not inviting and the food is totally weird
the concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly does work
the food they serve is not comforting not appetizing and uncooked
go to japanese sushi place or spanish tapas place this creation in williamsburg is misstake
good food
went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary
the food was great and tasty but the sitting space was too small do like being cramp in corner
over all it was very nice romantic place
would recommend to ask for bigger sitting area when you make reservation lrb if possible rrb
loved it
coworker and tried pacifico after work few fridays and loved it
the atmosphere was great
the food we ordered was excellent although would say the margaritas were anything to write home about
our waitress was mean but not especially warm or attentive either
must say am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year though
maybe it has improved since then
regardless we ll be back and ca wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio
dumbfoundingly poor
this was from start to finish mind bogglingly uncomfortable experience
lexicographers take note new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in brooklyn
the servers at flatbush farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention
polite acknowledgement is out
supercilious scorn is in
and how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing glance at people who are there to help you make the rent
different server enhanced the fun dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer lrb which was delicious rrb
overall the food quality was pretty good though hear the salmon is much better when it has sat cooling in front of the guest
the place has nice fit out some attractive furnishings and from what could tell reasonable wine list lrb was given the food menu when asked for the carte des vins rrb
at for two people however this in no way represents value unless you re looking to pay by the hour for passive aggressive torture
on that scale it world beater
how is this palce still open
honestly do even know where to begin
my boyfriend and are avid restaurant goers and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended flatbush farms
we arrived and were seated immediately which made us both happy
we ordered our appetizers ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon
everything was going good until we got our meals
took one look at the chicken and was appalled
it was served with skin over bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes
my boyfriend asked me if wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead while he de skinned the chicken so that could enjoy the white meat
took one bite from the salmon and have never in the years have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy as dry and as bland as the one in flatbush farms
at this point the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay was literally so shocked that was speechless and did say anything and guess what the waitress walked away
so switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe could stomach the meat and spinach again but the spinach was so undercooked that just could not bite through it
could even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach
ve had better chicken at bbqs
so decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible
guess what waited for twenty minutes before she came over and when she finally did she says oh well wish you would have said something earlier no apology nothing
after that she simply took our plates walked away came back another twenty minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it
no desert menu no apology nothing
was literally going to explode but instead my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager
this is where it really really gets bad the manager said there is absolutely nothing we can do it matter of taste that she did like it and can not comp it
again no apology no is there anything else can get you no can get you drink to make up for it nothing
we refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore
the level of rudeness was preposterous
the manager came to the table and said we can do what we want so we paid for what we did enjoy the drinks and appetizers and walked out
have never ever had such an unpleasant experience
this staff should be fired
cirspy crust margherita pizza
we have been there times since last week we alked it by chance first day the manager offerd us the margherita pizza adn we said yes
it was really good pizza
the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded rrb rrb rrb
you know what mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review
single worst restaurant in manhattan
ll being with couple of positives cool decor good pita and hummus and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty
moving on
if could give stars would do so for this place
casa la femme is to middle eastern dining what chuckie cheeze is to italian
the reason there are different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews
well they can run but they ca hide
live in the west village and ve been to lot of restaurants
sometimes you pay lot and do get much in return it manhattan things are expensive
however most of them are at least prompt and pleasant
this place god where do begin
it is quite spectacular scene ll give them that
the decor however seems to be the distraction so you wo notice that you just payed bucks for some cold eggplant that took frickin hours to come
how this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy or any other for that matter is beyond me
great hot dogs
ve made the trip out here few times with friend who lives nearby lrb live on uws rrb
though it been crowded most times ve gone here bark always delivers on their food
the hot dogs are top notch and they re slamwich is amazing
going to bark is always worth the train ride and will make your tongue and belly very happy
only complaint is the pricing believe it would be more reasonable to pay dollar less on each item listed on the menu
but nonetheless great spot great food
fabulous food if the front of house staff do put you off
we live nearby bfc
it little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions but we ve eaten there times in the last years
each time we ve been the front of house staff lrb not the waiters they re fantastic but the people who greet and seat you rrb has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes would never return
as bfc does take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated which can be over an hour later
the frizzy retro girl lrb with winged dame edna glasses rrb will yell at you if you try to order drink
was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at pm on friday night because she had bbq to go to that night wtf
be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely
there another girl who ca describe she is about with brown hair who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in except she only hears the last part of what you said so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you re really talking about
friendly person so would mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal
again be super upset if that were my employee
considering you will spend at least head expect better service
so if you re walking by and thinking about dining you might want to see who going to be seating you first
maitre eat and get out
my family ate here last weekend
the food and service were fine however the maitre was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant
while finishing our meals which included high end bottle of wine our son fiance joined us for glass of wine and dessert
this guy refused to seat her and she left followed shortly by the four of us but not before told him that in my years of world travel including paris that had never seen such display of bad behavior by frontman in restaurant
his response was smug arrogant and condescending totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening
word to the wise you ca dine here and disturb the maitre sense of table turnover as whacked as it is or else
if you go here do it on his off night
best meal in long time
mussles and calamari were superb saturday evening
had the lamb special which was perfect
my father had the flank steak which was very good and my mother had the swordfish
the four seasons restaurant is great experience
the food is great and the environment is even better
everyone must come here at least once
highly recommend it
taking hot dogs to the next level
at first glance this place seems bit pricey for hot dog joint but at bark you do just get your average hot dog
here the hot dog is elevated to the level of real entree with numerous variations available
great atmosphere
went to this place this place on real cold night and needed quick meal
highly recommend the fish tacos everything else was ok
cool atmosphere the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs bit more heat throughout on cold night
poor service and management
do go to this place
had an awful experience at casa la femme on saturday dinner
appetizers took nearly an hour
when the main course finally arrived lrb another mins rrb half of our order was missing
never got an explanation as to what was going on
the manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly
when we threatened to leave we were offered meager discount even though half the order was missing
on the way out we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues
ca believe how an expensive nyc restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients
what hassle
the food is very good but not outstanding
there is no way it justifies the accolades it receives the attitude of the staff or the wait for table
on our last visit they skipped over our name on the list leaving us waiting an extra hour for table
mistakes happen but they are usually accompanied by an apology perhaps even glass of wine but not the grunt that we received from the al di la staff
without the wait or attitude would probably go back but there are just too many other restaurants in brooklyn that are as good or better and do make me jump through hoops
expensive
went there after hearing how great it was
wow
the bread was stale the salad was overpriced and empty
the pasta was well cooked did have enough sauce though or flavor
though it was expensive and prefer bella via just blocks away by far
so rude
went with jwils
her review is above
was one of the people that went for this horrible experience
my friend is right in the experience we had
the hostess was rude and got distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us
the only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared
asked for menu and the same waitress looked at my like was insane
was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said can help you and how many are in your party
what
the three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were
we did look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately think that may have been part of the problem
shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non existent customer service
bad staff
generally like this place
the food is good
the design of the space is good
but the service is horrid
was there for brunch recently and we were tag teamed by waitress and waiter
the waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be plastic bag of garbage in one hand
ca believe that it was but please put the bag down before delivering food
the waitress came to check in on us every few minutes and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating lrb big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere so try to ignore it rrb
could ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends who was in mid bite to clear the table
she then put the check down without asking if we were done and came to check on the bill every two minutes even though we were one of three occupied tables
wish could like this place more and wish someone would retrain the staff
yum
serves really good sushi
not the biggest portions but adequate
green tea creme brulee is must
do leave the restaurant without it
no comparison
ca say enough about this place
it has great sushi and even better service
the entire staff was extremely accomodating and tended to my every need
ve been to this restaurant over dozen times with no complaints to date
snotty attitude
we were treated very rudely here one time for breakfast
the owner is belligerent to guests that have complaint
good food
we love breakfast food
this is great place to get delicious meal
we never had to wait more than minutes
the staff is pretty friendly
the onion rings are great
they are not greasy or anything
overrated
was highly disappointed in the food at pagoda
the lemon chicken tasted like sticky sweet donuts and the honey walnut prawns the few they actually give you were not good
the prices are outrageous especially since the food was actually less satisfying than most neighborhood chinese establishments
nice ambience but highly overrated place
will not go back
worst service ever had
group of of us went there for sunday brunch and sat outside
everyone that sat in the back outside agreed that it was the worst service we had ever received
our waiter was non existent and after our food finally arrived over an hour after we ordered we were not given any water or utensils
complained to the manager but he was not even apologetic
will never return again
fabulous italian food
highly recommend mioposto
am so happy to have wonderful italian restaurant in my neighborhood
the wine list is wonderful and the food reminds me of my recent trip to italy
love this restaurant
will never forget the amazing meal service and ambiance experience at this restaurant
it was absolutely amazing
the wine list is incredible and extensive and diverse the food is all incredible and the staff was all very nice good at their jobs and cultured
have not bad thing to say about this place
amazing
can not wait to go back again this coming weekend
mmm good
went there last night with friend
she had heard from co worker about this place
the food was great
it very reasonably priced esp for the quality of the food
had the kafta plate and it was perfect
we re going back
finally meal that you will remember for long time
in age of incremental cost cutting in restaurants its nice to see place that bucks that trend and just plain delivers high quality food and good service period
this is the place to relax and enjoy the finest quality food the industry can offer
caution its real food for people who love the best
some of the food is clearly oriented toward foodies lrb like me rrb so if your not foodie lrb nothing wrong with that rrb head over to mcdonalds or some ruby tuesday and have at it
if your looking for real quality lrb not the bs that is seen on yelp ratings which allegedly recently got in trouble for adjusting ratings rrb you need to get in here
very disappointing
took my parents here for their anniversary very very disappointed
liked the atmosphere very much but the food was not worth the price
may not be sushi guru but can tell you that the food here is just okay and that there is not much else to it
rice is too dry tuna was so fresh either
nothing really came across as outstanding
very disappointed
have eaten here three times and have found the quality and variety of the fish to be excellent
however the value and service are both severely lacking
portions contain less fish than one would expect particularly since prices are in line with the best sushi places in nyc lrb masa excluded of course rrb
furthermore while the fish is unquestionably fresh rolls tend to be inexplicably bland
the service ranges from mediocre to offensive
on recent trip our waiter was extremely dismissive while no less than three staff members waited hand and foot on pair of japanese girls seated nearby
we were then charged for their most expensive sake lrb per serving rrb when we in fact drank sake of less than half that price
but im sure this was just an honest mistake
freshest sushi love this restaurant
they pay such detail to everything from miso soup to complex rolls
the sashimi was the freshest and most tender have ever tasted
their apps are all delicious
the only drawback is that this place is really expensive and the portions are on the small side
but the space is small and lovely and the service is helpful
you are bound to have very charming time
not recommanded
the food was not great the waiters were rude
it is not worth going at all and spend your money there
great service
pretty cheap for sit down mexican and downtown
my service was stellar
the bus boy even spotted that my table was shaking stabilized it for me
food was fine with some little tastier than normal salsa
if you re in the area you should be disappointed
ok maybe went in on someone bad day
the food was great the margaritas too but the waitress was too busy being nice to her other larger party than to take better care of my friend and me
took forever to get our order taken water refills were too much to ask for and the only time she was fast was when we asked for our bill when we could get her attention
do know if ll be back
mama mia live in the neighborhood and feel lucky to live by such great pizza place
the only problem is you really have to warm up the pizza before it edible even when you order ahead
but once done it not too much dough not too much cheese not too much sauce
best sushi in town
have gone to all the top places
everything you want and more very fresh
its worth the wait especially since they ll give you call when the table is ready
the best calamari in seattle
and the best summertime deck experience they will even bring you blanket if you get cold in the seattle evening weather
perfect place to take out of town guests any time of the year
endless fun awesome music great staff
by far the best bar in the east village
went there with some friends one night to play bingo and watch the sox game and it was blast
every time sixtynine is called the bartender buys everyone drinks
been there lots since and its always good time
great draft and bottle selection and the pizza rocks
definitely has one of the best jukebox ve seen in long long time
found new home on second avenue
where can begin
ca
just go there and see for yourself
the food is great the bartenders go that extra mile
you need to watch your game they will have it on for you
the owners are great fun and the beer selection is worth staying for
and the upstairs is great place to hang out
not alot of smoking places left in new york but have found my favorite smoking balconey in the city
kudos to these guys
found new home and just moved with long lease
thank you
go beyond the california rolls
the sushi here is delicious
they have wide variety of fish and they even list which oceans they come from atlantic or pacific
ve had the jellyfish horse mackerel blue fin tuna and the sake ikura roll among others and they were all good
my only negative comment is that wish the pieces were little bigger
the decor is rustic traditional japanese
the crowd is mixed yuppies young and old
the service was courteous and attentive
mediocre food
we ate on the outside patio area for dinner on saturday night
the outside patio area has an abbreviated menu
we ordered the marinated grapes buffalo style chicken wings and the turkey sandwich
my and both agreed the food was very mediocre especially considering the price
we are locals and get the feeling the only way this place survives with such average food is because most customers are probably one time customer tourists
service was decent
drinks were good
unless you are just stopping in for few drinks would recommend going here
you are likely to be disappointed
excellent food nice ambience fairly expensive
loved the pumpkin ravioli and the goat cheese gnocchi lrb big ones to plate instead of or so little gnocchis rrb and my sister loved her filet mignon on top of spinach and mashed potatoes
the ambiance was peaceful and relaxing break amongst all the kids running around in downtown disney
it was romantic and even nice even with my sister reminded me of italy and had artwork and music that kept up the feeling of being in mediterrean villa
recommend it for night when you want to splurge lrb it was bit expensive rrb
best indian food in
ve been to over dozen indian places in and this is still my favorite
the best thing is the prices are also quite reasonable
the chicken curry and chicken tikka masala are my favorite meat dishes
the chana masala lrb garbanzo beans rrb are also excellent
it located in strip mall near the beverly center not the greatest location but the food keeps me coming back for more
hidden little jem
tucked away over by the beverly center
never too crowded and always great service
think have probably tried each item on their menu at least once it is all excellent
can highly recommend their various saag and paneer and korma
you routinely see indian families and friends dining there which is always good sign
appreciate their delivery too
nice food but no spice
really enjoyed my meal here
had yummy lamb korma saag paneer samosas naan etc
the food was all good but it was way too mild
normally places ask how hot you want it but they did
should have thought to bring it up but never expected the food to be that mild
will give them another chance and make sure to tell them to kick it up several notches
the naan was some of the best ve had and really enjoyed the bhartha not too tomatoey
even the chickpeas which normally find too dry were good
and they packaged everything nicely so it did spill
awesome find
do understand how was stranger to this place for so long the fajita salad the colorado the fajitas everything is delicious
love the warm cosy environment
just found out that you can have the place to yourself on nights and weekends for private party ca wait to celebrate my next birthday there
best restaurant in the world great decor great customer service friendly manager
first of all henrymillionare you dont know thing about middle eastern food so dont talk
cry me river stop complaining you obviously you have no taste in food
am never disappointed with there food
the atmosphere is great
and all you other people that have problem get some help
great lunch spot
great financial district mexican spot
always busy but they are good at seating you promptly and have quick service
everything ve had here is good taco salads burritos enchiladas love this place
also have great margaritas
you can order to go if you have to get back to the office too
lebanese food yum
ve been to open sesame only once but still reeling from the experience
the food is simply unforgettable
had the beef kabobs with side of cucumber yogurt
the presentation of the food was an added bonus it looked just as great as it tasted
my best friend had the chicken shawarma and she still raves about it being the best anywhere
her sister had the baklava for dessert
what tastly flaky treat
the staff are friendly and the decor was ethic and colorful
go to open sesame
holy hummus
the food is here is incredible though the quality is inconsistent during lunch
dinners have always been excellent in terms of food quality
the open sesame combo plate is bargain for the heap of food given
the side of potatoes is to die for as is the labne lrb yogurt dip rrb
also they serve the best hummus in america with drizzle of fragrant olive oil lrb which believe is the traditional way rrb
the only drawback is the crowded seating and the slow service
there have been several occasions when we ve just not gotten some side dishes we ve ordered
however this place is gem and wo stop going back
great beer
my first time to dine at this restaurant was with my son and it was absolutely horrible
we waited over minutes for our drinks and over hours for our food
swore never to return for warm beer and mediocre meal
however one sunday afternoon my husband and did go lrb although with my loud protests rrb and were pleasantly surprised
the band was very good and the service was attentive
outside in the area between the restaurant and the park children were running around while their parents sipped wine
we ordered selection of the small plates and the shoe string onions goat cheese pizza grilled asparagus and fried brie with fruit were all very good
it was like dining at completely different restaurant
we have since returned and also had great experience sampling more small plates and variety of the beer lrb cold and good rrb
we did have the same waiter the second time so maybe the service is spotty and our luck is good
sunday afternoons there is band playing and it is lots of fun
seattle best winelist
ray lrb suprisingly rrb has the city best most diverse wine list
the sommelier is fantastic down to earth extremely knowlegable
would go back for the wine experience alone
nice job
not the place it once was
it is sad to see place that was once the place to meet and eat for bfast or lunch now be the place that is big dont bother
the food is not what it once was lrb potions have seriously seen downsizing rrb prices have gone up and the service is the worst have experienced anywhere lrb including mainland europe rrb
what may be interesting to most is the worst sevice attitude comes from the owners of this establishment
this establishment really made marked decline after lrb and this is recurring story rrb the airing of food televisions diners drive ins and dives hosted by guy fieri in which schooner or later was subject of
perhaps now scooner or later falls into the dive category
this is sad for what once was one of the best places you could ever eat
hope one day scooner or later returns to what it once was
untill this happens my advice is to stay away
open cool place with the best pizza and coffee
mioposto has very creative delicious pizza menu
the coffe is very good too
great open and friendly ambience
this place is charming and relaxing
the servers behind the counter are always friendly and helpful
it reminds me of those great little restaurants in san francisco
it great place to enjoy food and meet friends
old reliable
after years in seattle ray rates as the place we always go back to
great food spectacular location and friendly service keep us coming back year after year
enjoyed the food
first of all am not from long beach
was visiting socal couple of months ago when the friend was visiting decided to take me to this restaurant
lrb she was actually going to take me to another mediterranean restaurant right across the street but they were not open yet even though it was few minutes past their opening time rrb
liked it
food was good and cheap
had the kafta plate and enjoyed it
it was so much though that could barely finish but did since it was delicious
atmosphere was nice
service was kind of slow our waitress took forever to give us our check even though it was that busy
still would recommend this place
btw really like long beach
it was one of the few places in socal where you would actually walk around and not have to take car
wow
it cant get any better
what else can you say nice people amazing food wow
great food with an awesome atmosphere
eggs pancakes potatoes fresh fruit and yogurt everything they serve is delicious
the best place for leisure sunday breakfast amidst yachts then take stroll through the nearby farmer market
great meal the fish on the omikase platter was absolutely decadent there was none of the stringiness that sometimes accompanies fair sushi this fish was perfect
plus am allergic to rice and the waitstaff was unbelievably accomodating did even bat an eye
and the waiter suggested perfect sake
absolutely fabulous
unbeatable sushi
two thumbs up
love sushi and have eaten it all over the world
this is right up there with places in tokyo as far as the freshness is concerned
melt in your mouth nigiri and sashmi and very tasty rolls too
be sure to try the oyster roll
splendid
how to describe the best sushi in nyc hmmmm delicious amazing fantastic suculent perfect nah all of the above
ca saybenough good things about this restaurant and ca wait for my next several visits
the best chuwam mushi have ever had
perfect on cold day
with tip
perfection
good sushi high price
one of the best sushi place in town
the house special roll is really good
on weekends you might have to wait for couple hours
however they do take your cellphone numbers so that you can go hang out somewhere else till they call you up on your cellphone
cozy spot for
ca believe murphy has been around for over years amazing
that huge compliment especially in the fickled restaurant business enough already
brunch at murphy is to die for my specialty egg white omelet the food is always freshly prepared
it the perfect spot for romantic date for or secret rendezvous
save room for scrumptious desserts
the restaurant offers an extensive wine list and an ambiance you wo forget
guarantee you wo be disappointed there also valet parking
addicting
best mexican place for lunch in the financial district
love the enchiladas and chicken soup and be sure to check out their specials
the cooks have been at the restaurant for years and cook family recipes
can get busy on fridays for table but once seated the service is so efficient you can be in and out of there quickly
went there with friend from out of town and we were both very impressed
went on monday night so there was no wait for table
the sushi was excellent and the wait staff was quick
the price was right too
the atmosphere was just okay
space was limited but the food made up for it
go back there in heartbeat
should have gone to trader joe and had frozen pizza lrb
my family went on midweek evening to have dinner
the restaurant was full and there was sign posted wait to be seated
well guess it hard to be seated when one is invisible to the staff
we stood there for minutes while employees walked back and forth ignoring us
finally my wife stood face to face in front of one of the staff and she asked are you waiting for table
once seated it took about minutes to finally get the meal
the prior reviews said kid friendly give me break with two young children that is light years
the caesar salad ordered had so much lemon could eat it
the pizza was slightly reminescent of baker beach pizza which occupied the the space years ago lrb distant second rrb
it was decent but nothing exceptional
this establishment is consistent with my feelings of the rest of chow foods group
we used to frequent most of their restaurants but over the years each one has really been disapointing
born and bred southend resident and was excited to hear of this restaurant opening
well guess maybe it might be beneficial for the management to pay visit to tutta bella in columbia city for some tips
great food better margaritas
this is one of my top lunch spots huge portions fast service and amazing margaritas
it gets really busy so get there on the early side so you can grab seat if you do have to wait its not bad because the service is quick
check out the art on the walls very colorful
love this place
have been eating at this place for over years now and have never had one bad meal
highly recommend this place to all that want to try indain food for the first time
the lunch menu is an awesome deal
plenty of food trust me
fresh ingrediants and super tasty
the place is the next best thing to my moms cooking
best food phenominal service
for the finicky sushi eater and those who have sampled the best nyc has to offer the fish is the freshest and the service is superb
not only can the selection be innovative but there nice balance of traditional sushi as well
the nicest waiters in town
way over rated
this place is unbelievably over rated
if want to stand in line on sunday for an hour to get average brunch food then would put murphy at the top of the list
the regular menu here is slightly above average that is not worth the snotty attitude that you receive

your sushi fan you love expertly cut fish great sake killer soho location and of course salmon tuna fluke yellow tail cod mackeral jellyfish sea urchin shrimp lobster sea bream trout milk fish blue fin tuna eel crab sardine monk fish roe scallop oysters and varity of toro
there is only one place on the east coast that has it all plus lot more
better than nobu tomoe taka yama sugiyama and the rest
bring your cell phone cause you may have to wait to get into the best sushi restaurant in the world blue ribbon sushi
believe it baby
cut to the chase this is amazing
it unpretentious and underground
it fresh welcoming delicious and relaxing
hands down the best tuna have ever had
blue ribbon lives up to it fantastic reputation
went here on recommendation and will surely return time and time again
what find
well worth it
great value sushi with high quality nice setting
good for late night dining lrb last minute planning rrb without reservations
try the chef choice for sushi as the smoked yellowtail was incredible and the rolls were also tasty
poor customer service poor pizza
as with most restaurants in seattle mioposto service was bad and the food was overpriced
know many people have their favorite types of pizza and pizza places but mioposto pizza lacks quality and good taste
to be honest ve had better frozen pizza
not kidding
the only positive thing about mioposto is the nice location
love it every time
was frankly shocked when read the bad reviews this place is fantastic it has not let us down in any way and we ve eaten here more than times
people complain about the dim lighting but that is one what love about this place if you want to stare at your food in bright light go to mcdonalds
the food is fantastic and the waiting staff has been perfect every single time we ve been there
the only problem would be the wait but we usually just have drink in the front while waiting
never had one single problem there
seafood plus
this was great dining experience
if you re going to see danny gans or just staying at the mirage do miss this one
the appetizer of oysters lobster crab lrb small size rrb made perfect entre for my wife
seabass on lobster risotto was the best
caesar salad was superb
great bottle of wine
leave room for dessert
completely over rated
will have to do more research before checking out new places based on diners drive ins and dives reviews
noice most reviews mention the bad service
the food was ok but the service was so poor that the food was cold buy the time everyone in my party was served
even then the order was not correct and we were still waiting for couple items
we had very hard time getting the waitress attention and finally had to get up and go inside to speak to manager
as it turns out the owner was seated right next to us and when he came over to check on our problems was very dismissive and offered token discount on our bill
when the bill came he only took the discount off the food and not the drinks
it was clear he did really care
with so many great breakfast lunch places in so cal this one is not worth the wait or any extra effort to visit
avoid the place
save yourself the waste of time do not visit
made my st trip to the restaurant after finding their webpage online
when got there sat up stairs where the atmosphere was cozy the service was horrible
waited for minutes for service ordered beer was never served again
after sitting there with my empty glass for over minutes left
went home looked them up online again where discovered there is link for give away that does work so emailed the restaurant about the non existent service deceptive link
never heard back from anyone more than month ago
after telling my friend about the situation he said lets try again but we will visit the lower bar
after sitting at the bar for over minutes the bar keep had made only drinks kept telling us she be right with us
we left without ever getting service
as of writing this just tried their give away link again it still does work
there are so many better places to visit
best crab cakes in town
thats big statement considering ve been pulling crab traps and making the cakes myself since was about seven but something about these little devils gets better every time
if you can come to this place by boat and make it whole evening
great seasonal fish and seafood with classy waterfront setting
always winner
great pizza poor service
love their pizza especially the mushroom pizza
also love their caeser salad
prefer to order it and pick it up though because do like the servers one young woman in particular
she does make you feel welcome and treats you like an annoyance
but she is very friendly with certain people making it even more annoying
management should really take notice and train their waitstaff and teach them some proper manners
many people talk about the great pizza and poor service so it ca just be the rantings of few dissatisfied customers
it great little place with tons of potential to be neighborhood joint if the service were so impersonal and corporate like
great breakfast
this place is famous for their breakfast
they have been featured on the food network and they deserve it
the food is great and they make mean bloody mary
love breakfast here
their crab eggs benedict is addicting
all their menu items are hit and they serve mimosas
does get any better than that
best chinese food have tasted in long time
we got groupon for pagoda and decided to try it on thursday night
there was guy playing the piano and singing at the bar area which was separate from the dinning area
you can easily hear him though so it was pleasant sound and not overbearing
the ambiance of the restaurant was nice and good for fine dinning
not too fine thought that you feel uncomfortable and have to dress up
the staff was very nice and courteous and obviously chinese
we ordered the honey walnut prawns which we always order at every chinese restaurant to determine the quality of food
first off the food came fast and all together rrb like that hate the pretentiousness of things coming in one after the other
so about the prawns they were fresh and had slight crispiness about the batter soooo good the walnuts were cut in smaller pieces and very crunchy and tasty
yummy
best honey walnyt prawns that we have every tasted
next one that we ordered were prawns and scallop with brocolli
the brocollis were so fresh and tasty
would normally not finish the brocolli when order these kinds of food but for the first time every piece was as eventful as the first one the scallops and prawns was so fresh and nicely cooked
not chewy at all
for desert we had the mango ginger creme brulee oh la la yummy
melt in your mouth
we are for sure coming back to this restaurant
every month if possible
it is sad there is not many people who frequent eating at places like these that look pricey because they are at the hotel but they are definitely one you dont want to miss esp if your in downtown san jose
chintzy portions
the sushi here is perfectly good but for piece either the slices of fish should be larger or there should be no pretense that this is moderately priced restaurant lrb even for nyc rrb
we easily spent more than per person lrb not including alcohol rrb and were still hungry
astonished that this restaurant is categorized as rather than
terrible service food ok pricey
this past weekend had great weather for san francisco standards
so for the after beach excursion we thought we would end the day on high note and make the trip across the street from the beach to park chalet
the restaurant was busy however there were few tables open
we put out name down and although there were open tables we were told that it be minute wait
so here we are my wife year old daughter and trying to pass the time by hanging out in the front of the building lrb where the murals and artifacts are rrb
minutes went by and sure enough the pager buzzer went off
we went back to the restaurant and low and behold we were seated at one of the tables that was available minutes ago
logic behind that
none that can think of
we put in our order and although we ordered appetizers the food did arrive until minutes later with our main course
um so now what are appetizers for
oh forgot to mention that they do have bread service
its good thing my daughter had some snacks in her lunch bag
my wife also ordered teapot of hot water lrb she had sore throat rrb and guess that since it was only water it was priority for them to actually bring it
in other words if they are making off of you then you do rate high on their service scale
food wise its ok but bit pricey for what you get considering the restaurant is fancy place
the upside of the restaurant
if needed to name some they would include the location to the beach or golden gate park
its great if you spent the day there and did want to drive to eat
parking is reasonably good they have their own lot and you can park in the park nearby
another plus is the open feel of the restaurant with glass walls on all sides
hate for tourists to go to park chalet and think that this is how all san francisco restaurants are like
always good
sushi fiend friend recently visited and our group of three just had to come for dinner
pm on sat before broadway play and we were quickly seated and served
amazing spanish mackeral special appetizer and perfect box sushi lrb that eel with avodcao um um um rrb
as usual the omikase did disappoint in freshness although it scored low on creativity and selection
their specialty rolls are impressive though ca remember what we had
great selection of sakes
green tea creme brulee gets better each time have it
it is the cheapest sushi but has been worth it every time
very poor customer service
schooner or later charming location along the marina in long beach and average food does not unfortunately compensate for its very poor customer service
while this diner had reasonably good food the restaurant staff seemed completely indifferent to our presence and this attitude was reflected in the lack of service
as part of small party of four our food was dropped off without comment
any further needs we may have had could not have been met since no one stopped by the table
when we finally were able to flag someone down it was someone entirely different from the person who had dropped off the food who was also not the same person who had taken our order
after one member of our party had been bumped repeatedly by waitress polite request that he not be bumped sent the waitress into an abusive rant
brief conversation with the manager at the end of the meal was the greatest disappointment to say we had been blown off would be an understatement
the manager continually interrupted with is there anything else can do for you strange comment because she had hardly listened let alone responded to our expression of disappointment at our experience
she promised to speak to the waitress who had flown off in rage but we could hardly take her promise seriously seeing as she had bothered to get the waitresses name
in short schooner or later could have cared less about our being at their establishment
next time we will go somewhere else or try other restaurants close by like mimi cafe and claim jumper
clock in the morning
you are with hot date and he she has an urge for sushi then this might be the place
the fish was fresh though it was cut very thin
great service
good sake selection
dungeness crabs here
ray is the place to go for high quality seafood dinners
and they give good quantity for the price
we were only in seattle for one night and so glad we picked rays for dinner
love dungeness crabs and at ray you can get them served in about different ways
we shared the family platter and especially enjoyed the black cod in sake kasu
ended the meal with the unusual dessert of port and chocolate tasting yummy
and the service was simply spendid quite delight
great breakfast
great drinks corn beef hash coffee fast burritos gluten free menu
the service is fantastic at this fun place
if there is line very day of the week for the entire time place is open you know it is great
this is the case at this gem
best neighborhood standby
you ca go wrong here
every neighborhood has few great local bars that are the best secrets
in grammercy union square east village this is my neighbors and my favorite spot
the music is great no night better or worse the bar tenders are generous with the pouring and the lighthearted atmosphere will lifts you spirits
seriously you ca go wrong if it is unpretentious local fun you seek
oh and the cheese fries are awesome
good food great service average prices lrb for the strip rrb
decided to eat at stack because of their price fixed pre show dinner
when walked in was taken aback by their incredible wood decor
the music playing was very hip something pop music but the subwoofer to the sound system was located under my seat which became annoying midway through dinner
we were quickly seated and requested the special dinner which came with rrb shellfish and shrimp appetizer or caesar salad rrb oz steak lrb with single potato chip rrb and rrb homemade donut holes
got the shellfish and shrimp appetizer and it was alright
it was the freshest seafood ever but the taste and presentation was ok
before the steak came the server told us that the steak did not come with any sides and suggested pick something from the menu
picked the asparagus which turned out to be incredible and perfectly prepared
it was steamed and tossed with garlic
the oz steak came next and it tasted great at least initially
the steak was done to my exact liking lrb medium rare rrb and was nice and juicy
it served with either peppercorn sauce or red wine reduction though both were in taste
though one thing realized later on was that the restaurant either used msg or meat tenderizer on the steak
my mouth felt very dry afterwards and had that signature msg taste lingering in my throat after left the restaurant
finally the homemade donut holes were served for desert
they came in their own nifty take out box and with some homemade frosting very light and not too sweet
the desert was the perfect ending to an almost perfect dinner
the dinner only took us about an hour and the prices were alright for the strip almost pp after tax and tip lrb about average rrb
but the servers were extremely attentive and very friendly
overall would go back and eat at the restaurant again
just remember to dress little urban chic so you don look too far out of place
good sake good food honestly do know much about japanese food at all
in the past sake usuallly just tasted kind of like salty water to me
server made several sake suggestions which were very good
had many dishes but the best was the lobster ways
very good
overpriced
we dined at the colorado location today
waited minutes for table for which was ok for such big crowd
the waiter was bit unfriendly and the feel of the restaurant was crowded
also there was only one bathroom stall probably need more for such big crowds
most importantly we were so excited about the food after seeing the very creative menu
at best the food was good and definately overpriced
for the amount of food we got the prices should have been lower
not sure if would go back
my favortie pizza joint in seattle
this is my must bring out of town guests to restaurant and they always enjoy and rave about it
in fact many want to return second time during their visit
the pizza is delicious and the salads are fantastic
ve always found the wait staff and if you sit at the bar the cooks very friendly
they are the most talkative but everytime ve been there they have been very busy which probably accounts for the lack of conversation
also really enjoy the simplicity of the decor and intimate feeling of small restaurant
it just the right size for the menu
excellent
my husband and love eating at mioposto café
we re ca say enough about their delicious gourmet pizza
you wo be disappointed by their menu
the pizza are thin crust and the menu offers very creative combinations and toppings
you never feel icky and stuffed after you eat there
the pizza are light and scrumptious
try the pizza ensalata
it salad on top of pizza crust
absolutely delicious
the pizza are not huge and the crust is thin keep that in mind when you re ordering
worth the wait
had to wait thirty minutes to get in the door on tuesday morning but it was so worth it
the food is sinful
the staff was really friendly
the atmosphere was great
the specialty here is decadent pancakes but ve been back now four times and ve been wowed every time
nothing on the menu is less than amazing
go with some friends wait the half hour or so with cup of joe and enjoy more than your average breakfast
good eats
whose writing all the great reviews
why is it that lrb almost rrb every good review is by anonymous
do know why anyone would want to write great review about this place
have been to this place folks and it is bad
maybe it is good for that one night once in blue moon when the chefs decide to use fish that half way decent
have been here spent tons of money on chef special dinner and it was major dissappointment
fancy pieces of exotic fish on dollar plate and not one was eatable
donot go
delicious
the atmosphere is great for any special occasion you might want to celebrate
the best dish are the honwy walnut prawns just outstanding
the service is really attentive and charming
locations
they have locations
the listed and then one in southglenn mall parking lot which is reviewed here and one in ft collins
we waited for an hour to be seated
the service was excellent the coffee was good even by starbucks standards and the food was outstanding
it was worth the wait
plan on waiting minutes
will definitely be back
southglenn is largest location
delicious
recently had the pleasure of dining as this delightful restaurant on nd street and wow what great evening we had
the food is fantastic authentic delicious and very very affordable
the decor was beautiful and unique
there was really nice vibe about the place good music atmosphere and happy looking people
our server was very professional and friendly
to the owners of open sesame bravo ca wait to come back to dine at your restaurant
delectable
it tiny place so if you get there before pm on weekend lrb thurs sun rrb you will find it easier to get table or seat at the sushi bar
once you re inside the real experience begins
everything and mean everything on the menu is delectable
the waiters are very experienced and helpful with pairing your drink choice to your food tastes or vice versa
the sushi is as fresh as it comes you think ocean was in their backyard no joke
if you re interested in good tasting lrb without the fish taste or smell rrb large portions and creative sushi dishes this is your place
big thick pepperoni
the pepperoni cut real thick yum
the pizza itself is not exactly the best ve had ever but still pretty good
probably would go back though cuz do know if it worth it
maybe ll go back once more many years from now when ve forgotten went there already
sit in the balcony
not bad
food was good and appetizing
portions was just enough for me but may not be for big eater
fair menu selection
the appetizer was interesting but the creme brulee was very savory and delicious
indoor ambience was modern
if it nice outside request for table in the balcony
it great place to people watch
although the service could be improved considering the money you put in
our drinks kept coming but our server came by couple times
should check up on us more frequently do you think
late night dinning with exeptional food
did want to go there because of the reviews and prices saw on the internet
that was the last night in vegas and was too late and most of the restaurant were closing so we walked in the check the place
we were seated right away the table was private and nice
the service was exceptional sometime there was feeling that we were served by the army of friendly waiters
the food was very good filet mignon was probably the best ve ever try
the portions are big though so do not order too much
groovy music made the dinner casual
the most pleasant surprise was the check that did not exceed my expectations as it always happens in most of the places
have but here there was bathroom attendant in the restroom which was odd
the bathroom itself is very small with two toilets and only one sink the girl was staying totally on the way hanging out paper towels from the dispenser
there were bottles of perfume on the sink and the line of girls trying to use the sink
felt ackward and next time went to the casino bathroom
this place rocks
mercedes restaurant is so tasty the service is undeniably awesome
the chips and salsa are so yummy and the prices are fabulous
the atmosphere is aspiring and the decor is festive and amazing
the catering is out of this world and raouls chicken vegetable soup rocks my world
drinks are suberb and feel like am in third world country when walk in the door
insultingly overpriced
mediocre service quality
this review is for the southglen location which is not listed in citysearch wish this review would make difference enough for it to be addressed by management but snooze has people climbing over each other for chance to eat at this overpriced restaurant with mediocre food and service so this review as well as the other negative ones for their larimer location will go unaddressed
the presentation of snooze is excellent and it is one of those places that you feel more sophisticated just for being there but peel back the layers and you have an overpriced ihop with high brow menu
to start off approximately oz of orange juice will cost you
they serve it in tall skinny hour glass shaped glass to disguise the fact that you getting small juice at the price of half gallon in supermarket
should have just asked for the check when saw that but their menu was so unique that continued
the pancakes were certainly inventive but for pancakes lrb one of them was more like rrb in the pancake flight lrb sample of different pancakes rrb is well over priced
the pancakes should be larger lrb at least rrb to justify the expense even with the unique offerings
the flavors were good but have had far better pancakes at german pancake specialty restaurant that were little cheaper but significantly larger
on my meal had to send back my eggs for simple request of breaking the yokes before cooking and would have had to send them back again if had rejected the meal all together
rejected it because in the process of attempting to fix the eggs they broke something else in the dish and was too frustrated to continue
to their credit they removed the dish from the check but no manager stopped by to ask what the problem was
in the end our check came to for small pancakes breakfast burrito an orange juice and an iced tea lrb had water rrb
this was times what the same meal would have cost at le peep
snooze provided an inventive pancake offering but le peep would have provided better service and quality
much more than just great view
am exceedingly pleased to report that my dinner at ray boathouse last friday completely exceeded my expectations
ray is something of seattle institution but given its gorgeous sound views had suspected that the accolades were more due to the scenery than to the food and service
imagine my happy surprise upon finding that the views are only the third best thing about ray
to start things off our lovely server brooke was quickly on hand to take my drink order
my party of two was feeling particularly ambitious and we splurged on the shilshole sampler beautiful assortment of enormous white gulf prawns smoked albacore tuna ray fantastic manila clams seasoned with dill scallops in tasty soy dressing and tiny pile of dungeness crab atop sublime butter sauce
for my entr eacute completely enjoyed the seared alaskan sea scallops complemented by chard artichoke hearts fennel and pecorino toscano
the scallops are apparently cooked in black olive butter which really makes them unique lrb not to mention tasty rrb
my friend enjoyed the grilled alaskan king salmon with delectable creamed washington russet potatoes and crisp green beans
had taste of all three items on her plate and they were superb
our server continued to be attentive throughout the night but did remain puzzled by one issue who thinks that ray is an appropriate place to take young children for dinner
two rascally kids were seated near us for the first part of our dinner they were replaced by delightful preteen who pretended to gag every time seafood was mentioned at her table
given that ray is seafood restaurant well you get the idea
all considered have to say that ray boathouse is deserving of its title as seattle institution
while could have done without the youth who shared the evening with us our wonderful server and food made the experience very positive one
oh yeah the view was good too
this computer is absolutely amazing
plus hours of battery
super fast processor and really nice graphics card
and plenty of storage with gb though will upgrade this and the ram
this computer is really fast and shocked as to how easy it is to get used to
ve only had mine day but already used to it
get this computer for portability and fast processing
the laptop was really good and it goes really fast just the way thought it would of run
would really recommend to any person out there to get this laptop cause its really worth it
and its really cheap and you wont regret buying it
as computer science student in college find that the portability longevity and ease of use of this computer make me shockingly want to do homework more
without big ol clunky machine in my backpack feel like can do programming homework anywhere
highly recommend this computer for students looking for solid machine to get them through college
great feature is the spotlight search one can search for documents by simply typing keyword rather than parsing tens of file folders for document
oh my goodness am not happy camper
my hp is very heavy
not easy to carry
the battery has never worked well
the battery gets so hot it is scary
yet hp won do anything about the problem
returned the computer to hp and they kept it for months
when got the computer back and realizwed it still was not correct hp told me it was out of warranty and now it was my problem
so you can imagine how unhappy am with this item
currently if use the laptop can sit it on my lap because it will burn my legs
well they don care bunch
but at the same time they the company would not and could not do anything about my problem
would say if you want to buy one of these machines be careful
and if you are going to deal with hp be careful
in my house hp is nasty word
since purchased my toshiba netbook have been very pleased with it have laptob and desktop
the netbook is easier for me to take to bed and carry around with me
the screen takes some getting use to because it is smaller than the laptop
have not have any problems
the notebook pc toshiba qosmio is the best gift my father could have ever gotten me
he gave me this pc about years ago and up to this point im still sitting here using it
its still going
it is in the best condition and has really high quality
this is something would deffinately reccomend to someone
you will not regret buying such great thing like this
it can get any better
waited on getting this computer but it has been great change
ease of use is just one of the benefits love about my mac
this laptop meets every expectation and windows is great
it fast it easy easy easy to set up easy to hook to my wireless network
it even easy to hook up to other wireless networks
the battery doesn last long but sure an upgrade battery would solve that problem
don use my laptop in way though that needs long battery life so it perfect for me
most everything is fine with this machine speed capacity build
the only thing don understand is that the resolution of the screen isn high enough for some pages such as yahoo mail
bought it for really cheap also and it amazing
recommended to people as their first laptop
plain and simple it laptop runs great and loads fast
easy to carry can be taken anywhere can be hooked up to printers headsets
already hooked on the sleek look and dependability that this laptop has shown
being pc user my whole life it taking bit of time to adapt to the os of mac but finding my way around
the unibody design is edgy and durable
the led backlit display makes my pictures pop so much more
learning the finger options for the mousepad that allow for quicker browsing of web pages
key contributor that led me to mac is the art aspect
they have developed excellent proprietary software for editing video and pictures and looking forward to utilizing these tools on the regular
excited to learn more about what this powerful machine has to offer and encourage others to do the same
it more expensive but well worth it in the long run
great product very easy to use and great graphics
one drawback wish the keys were backlit
glad bought this laptop it was worth the few extra dollars
it had most of the features and all of the power that wanted to replace my desktop machine
wasn really as concerned about portability it very large laptop but it not hard to move around or take on trip which was pleasant surprise
very happy with this machine
love the size keyboard the functions
don really have complaint
it is easy to use good quality and good price
perfect trifecta
would recommend this product
the salesman talked us into this computer away from another we were looking at and we have had nothing but problems with software problems and just not happy with it
this is my first dell heard their customer service was lacking and that they were working on improving it
the dvd burner broke after burning dvd during that time
they sent me replacement part and without informing me are requiring that return it within days or contact them and let them know the broken part will be returned later
if this is an improvement in customer service then would hate too see what it was before
spoke to different people and was told they needed to transfer me to th person
needless to say told them no and have nice day and hung up
can guarantee this will be the last dell will ever purchase
breaking within year of purchase and speaking to people to report the damaged part will be returned late
do not recommend this company or their products
so far great product
high price tag however
still trying to learn how to use it
it is the worst computer dell ever made
it is hard to fix and makes it hassle to own one
breaks easily
only good thing is the graphics quality
there are so many wonderful features and benefits to the new macbook
no viruses
this laptop is fast and you will literally learn all you can do with this dynamo by just watching the online tutorials
am loyal to apple
am very happy
this just keeps having it hard drive replaced
acer won replace the laptop
the manufacturer warranty only covers replacement repair of parts
this thing is lemon
this macbook is an outstanding product with great value
its ease of use and the top service from apple be it their phone assistance or bellying up to the genius bar cannot be beat
suffice it to say my macbook pro keeps me going with its long battery life and blazing speed
it does run little warm but that is negligible concern
have had nothing but problems since the day took it out of the box
my first problem was with the pre loaded norton firewall security program
it would not let me connect to my wifi system where lived
it took toshiba tech support calls and different techs to correct the problem
then just the other day my left mouse button snapped
being only months old am not happy camper
buyer beware
this one in my opinion might be lemon
it rarely works and when it does it incredibly slow
have had to take it to the geek squad guys to get it fixed because it has had viruses times and have not even had it for more then months
if you are looking for good laptop this is not it
like the price and operation
some features arent friendly volume wheel sound quality etc
but for the cost this is winner
absolutely love my mac
can imagine my life without it anymore
ve haven had any major problems with the laptop except that the plastic piece that covers the usb port wires have all come off
apparently they are defective since they are not securely attached
can barely use any usb devices because they will not stay connected properly
called toshiba and they want me to be without my laptop for about two weeks while they look at the problem
think might rather suffer for something that is simple to fix in my opinion
bought this laptop was the worst laptop ve ever bought
spent alot of money on this product and its been nightmare
and having to deal with the company has been even worse nightmare
they sent it back with huge crack in it and it still didn work
and that was the fourth time ive sent it to them to get fixed
its been year and am still waiting to see what there going to do about my laptop
so if anyones looking to buy computer or laptop you should stay far far away from any that have the name toshiba on it
saved for this laptop for months and can tell you personally it was worth the wait
the display on this computer is the best ve seen in very long time the battery life is very long and very convienent
little pricey but it is well well worth it
it is amazing
in the first moth of owning this computer its hardrive failed which had to be replaced
after replacing the hard drive the battery stopped working months of use which was frustrating
then after or so months the charger stopped working so was forced to go out and buy new hardware just to keep this computer running
tip for people looking into this computer do not buy it save up bit more money and buy computer that will last
has hour battery life
it is easy to use and lightweight
was very much worth the price paid
this netbook went bad on me after days
there is blank lighted screen when start and that is all
three weeks after bought the netbook the screen quit working
baby my electronics so know for fact it was defective and not anything that did to it
overall feel this netbook was poor quality had poor performance although it did have great battery life when it did work
took the netbook on vacation trip and was able to do whatever wanted to do without lugging much heavier laptop
the so called laptop runs to slow and hate it
do not buy it
it is the worst laptop ever
the image is great and the soud is excelent
love ths notebook
love the glass touchpad
easy learning curve
also the display is exceptional
have loved this since took it out of the box
the battery is really long
the features are great the only thing it needs is better speakers
small and light weight
speakers too small to be of any real use
keyboard good sized and wasy to use
like it
meets my needs perfectly and is light enough for this senior to carry without affecting my arthritis
needless to say not to happy with the product
this is great machine
the design is awesome quality is unprecedented
apparently well built and gorgeous to look at the macbook pro is winning combination of price and performance
it is by far one of the greatest investments have ever made
am very glad bought it great netbook low price
very good quality and well made
great pick for portability and affordability
the black model also has very nice seamless appearance one of the better looking notebooks ve seen
the only problem is lack of screen resolutions
if you need an affordable entry level laptop this will fit the bill
dislike the weight and size cubersome
dislike the quality and the placement of the speakers
overall it ok
laptop is advertised as but the casing looks like that of
this laptop is very large and barely fits in any carrying cases
peformance is good for the price
if you re not wanting to be mobile this is good laptop to sit on desk
had to have this computer repaired twice in the first months after purchasing it
not good for person who gets online daily
may be better for the occasional web surfer
just got this laptop for college and so far am very happy with it
it is so much easier to use
good keyboard long battery life largest hard drive and windows
and toshiba is quality supplier
love this little one
the keyboard has wonderful nature feel
great battery life
keyboard is reasonable size
small screen somewhat limiting but great for travel
charger seems large for this class of computer
great laptop for the price works well with action pack games
the only thing that have is the key broad is little dark to see the letters would help if it was little lighter then it is
but other then that would give this product in hafe stars
good for every day computing and web browsing
great computer for light home use and business use
might not make the avid gamer happy but don really think that is what this computer is designed for
crisp screen great battery life and plenty of storage
very happy
he loves it and it is easy to use and well the schools start teaching the kids early about computers so it was easy for him to get started
would recomend this acer to parents and grandparents it can really help them in school
my only problem is can not reg the product key
it want take it it keep saying error
help help other than that gets great little wonder
it fast and has excellent battery life
the screen shows great colors
was surprised with the performance and quality of this hp laptop
the speed is fine
but with way bigger screen and is able to connect to an hdmi
love it
would recommend this computer to anyone searching for the perfect laptop and the battery life is amazing
bought this lap top and the charge time dosen last as long as they say it will more like hours
this computer is the ideal college companion
it software and speed enable it to do amazing things
am not happy at all with the product purchased
cheaper price should not equal cheap product
it was over rated
the toshiba laptop was great purchase
the price was very good and the product is top quality
the delivery was fast and would not hesitate to purchase this laptop again
it has easy to use features and all the speed and power could ask for
true quality at great price
am enjoying it and the quality it provides is great
toshiba is great brand even though haven had it for long time am very happy with it
the screen graphics and clarity and sharpness are great
ve already recommended this laptop to friend who eye the computer when took it out of my bag
like the laptop overall
the only thing can say is that the touch pad doesnt work like it should all the time
sometimes you really have to tap the pad to get it to work
this is great little computer for the price
simple to use and great graphics
it has everything would need for home computer
very impressed
it was secure and easy to navigate
it is everything that would want in computer
besides the great look it is great machine
once again apple stands alone at the top of the charts
enjoy very much my new toshiba purchased specifially for attending online schooling
have found it very easy to use very imformative wonder alerts and tutorials making it very easy for someone like me who is not exactly technologically advanced to learn to use the various features and programs
have found also it is very easy to be able to access wireless internet access without having to have extra equipment and or complicated routes to take to be able to do so
also love the small convenient size of my laptop making it perfect tool for my academic studies
am very pleased with my purchase
this laptop serves all my needs
screen size is perfect for portable use in any environment
price and purpose is awesome
have been very pleased with the performance of this laptop
the battery life seems to be very good and have had no issues with it
great product
the laptop was very easy to set up
everything was so easy
they were able to set up with labtops themselves within few minutes
it works fine with our wireless and they ve had not problems
it great product for great price
waited on getting this computer but it has been great change
ease of use is just one of the benefits love about my mac
the service received from toshiba went above and beyond the call of duty
my friend reports the notebook is astonishing in performance picture quality and ease of use
it is extremely portable and easily connects to wifi at the library and elsewhere
just what the doctor ordered
cannot be happier with the service or product
power supply went bad after weeks
after much effort and days asus replaced it
the wifi is very weak
summary spend your money elsewhere
this is nicely sized laptop with lots of processing power and long battery life
love it so far
the toshiba net book operates very well
the only objection have is that after you buy it the windows system is starter and charges for the upgrade
bought this netbook for traveling and it great light functional and meets my needs
the touchpad is extremely sensitive which is the only drawback
otherwise love it
wasn really sure wanted to spend that kind of money
it was great deal after all
love it
should have bought one long time ago
not enough time for me to give it stars
ve had the macbook pro for about three weeks and it really is great computer
have only had pcs with windows before so this takes little getting use to
the real stand out on this computer is the feel of the keyboard and it speed
it is fast booting up shutting down and connection with the internet
the one thing wish it had was detailed hardcopy manuel
think the manual is somewhere on the hard drive but rather have hard copy
if what you need is machine to do some surfing email checking word processing and watching movie or two this is the machine you want
it priced very reasonable and works very well right out of the box
nice and portable and definitely decent enough system to keep you entertained while sitting in the airplane for couple of hours or at the hotel taking care of some last minute details and documents
the screen video resolution won increase to higher resolution then
that being said it still runs video in full screen decently
the sound is bit quiet if you re on plane this can easily be overcome with decent pair of head phones
bottom line doubt you be overly disappointed if you invest in this machine
yes thought the expese was little much but now realize you get what you pay for
love my apple it is quick and easy to use
ve had to call apple support to set up my new printer and have had wonderful experiences with helpful english speaking from vancouver techs that walked me through the processes to help me
can say enough of how satisfied am with their product and help aftermarket
money and time well spent
highly recommended
the macbook pro just fits in my budget and with free shipping and no tax to ca this is the best price we can get for great product
the macbook arrived in nice twin packing and sealed in the box all the functions works great
speakers doesn sound that great
love the speed especially
so glad decided to upgrade
ve owned this labtop for less then two months already the mouse button has broke
still under warrenty so called toshiba no help at all
stuck broken computer
will not buy another toshiba this is my second not happy either
love its solid build light wt and excellent battery life for now
excellent led monitor and well equipped
love the apple products
the toshiba mini notebook model nb bl is great little computer
it is easy to use its keyboard easily accommodates large hands and its weight is fantasic
upgrading from windows starter thru windows home premium to windows professional was snap
both upgrades were quickly accomplished after purchasing the necessary product key
other installed features such as certain printer software are also most attractive
ever since bought this laptop so far ve experience nothing but constant break downs of the laptop and bad customer services received over the phone with toshiba customer services hotlines
constantly had to send my laptop in for services every months and it always seems to be the same problem that they said they had already fixed
toshiba customer services will indirectly deal with your problems by constantly tranferring you from one country to another and am not kidding you called different hours of the day and you ll get someone else from another country trying to get you to tell them your life story all over again since they make it sound like they don have your history list of your calls right in front of them
it long and tirring process that after while it seems like their game plan was to wear you out so you would want to give up on contacting them
and at one point they blame me for installing bad memory stick when upgrade my memory for the first time during my purchase of the laptop bought the memory stick they recomended
long story short since experience so many problems with my laptop every since bought it from day one didn ask for new laptop or refund of what pay for crapy laptop but just an extension of my laptop warranty for another year they made big deal of out that and after so many calls and complaints about their products and services they finally gave in
was this product worth my time and money to ever want to purchase another products that is toshiba or relating to toshiba
ll rather be out of date then spend more money on toshiba
remember to do your research first before consider buying toshiba product
all can say is
this laptop is insane
it so nice to look at and the keys are easy to type with
bought protector for my key pad and it works great
this is definitely computer worth the money
the mouse is little bit different than what you re used to though it has one big flat panel and one full bar instead of two separate ones to click with but you get used to it quite quickly
and the best part is that it even comes with free printer when they have certain promotion offer going of course
overall this laptop is definitely keeper with its simple yet stylish design and its array of fantastic colors to choose from
the apple team also assists you very nicely when choosing which computer is right for you
obviously this macbook is for me because it does exactly what need in an easy to function way
definitely recommended
not bad laptop it bit slow but gets the job done
the lcd screen stopped working on mine after months
could not find phone number anywhere to call an actual live person for tech support and had to result the their online chat
upon giving them the serial number the first thing was told was that it was out of warranty and could pay to have it repaired even though had the receipt in front of me proving it still had months left on the warranty
even though had the receipt in front of me proving it still had months left on the warranty
dealing with the support drone on the other end of the chat was sheer torture
english must have been his third or fourth language
his language was so bad swore was taking the turing test and it was failing
after trying to get some help he disconnected on me
after days being denied times and told off once managed to get through and was able to send them scanned copy of the receipt
then they had me jump through many hoops and questions to see if they could find another way to invalidate me
after they found no other way they told me to courier it to them since they don allow the use of the post office at my expense and sent me page list of very specific packaging instructions to follow or it wouldn be covered
managed to comply with these too and now have to wait and see if they can find another way to screw me
they really do have the worlds very worst repair service
this computer gets very hot before shutting down
it is not ideal for children because of the temp
contacted hp about this situation and was given excuses without results
they didn even try to assist me or even offer replacement
will never purchase hp again ever
let just get this out of the way love apple
but the macbook is the best
it is super easy to use
all you have to do is turn it on and it works
it is very durable am pretty rough when it comes to electronics and it has taken it all with no reprecutions yet
don do any high tech stuff on it just write papers check mail and sometimes play games so can reccomend it if you are in the computer field
in the past four years ve had it have never once gotten virus
did have to replace the battery once but that was only couple months ago and it been working perfect ever since
would definitely reccomend this if you are in the market for an easy to use stylish fun awesome computer
also it is very good for college students who just need reliable easy to use computer
this laptop does everything need it to very well
the best thing about this laptop is the price along with some of the newer features
the screen is bright and the keyboard is nice
find myself using the key more than thought would
battery is lasting about hours as am surfing the web on sundays while checking football scores and watching funny youtube videos
for those that care about noise this thing doesn really make any
the processor doesn seem to run hot and the fan rarely turns on
took off star because the machine has lot of junk software on it
wish toshiba would allow their customers to select an option that only boots the os at setup and removes all the unnecessary stuff
once removed all the software the laptop loads in seconds
this is not serious gaming laptop or serious media machine
my niece and nephew have played few web games and it runs anything that doesn require dedicated video card
overall am very satisfied with the purchase
great quick laptop for the money
right size and weight for portability
battery life needs more life
battery is not upgradable to longer life battery
love everything about it
the only downfall is the battery only last hrs when not plugged in
would like at least hr battery life
otherwise all other features are
this mac is great
lightweight long battery life excellent transition from pc
this has been nothing but headache since we purchased it
will never buy refurbished again don cae how cheap it is
just don waste your time and money on this
tried giving it stars but had to choose at least one but imo no stars
summary dont buy hp
if you buy pray you dont have major prolems
runs hot
thought we were paying for quality in our decision to buy an apple product
after little more than year of owning my macbook pro the monitor has completely died
this purchase opened me to the world of macbooks and am impressed with the intuition of the design the beauty of the product and the excellent technological advances associated with it
then of my nephews were going into music and both fell in love with the macbook pro
now they are believers in the product
it is easy to use has great screen quality and every so light weight
this little netboook is helping me get work done
homeschool my kids and with this netbook next to my desk we get to teaching and illustrating without skipping beat
am first time mac buyer and am amazed at features and ease of use the mac offers
bought it for my mom and she reports that the battery life lasts all day for her it very lightweight and the response for the computing she doing internet focused activity mail research etc is excellent
the overall build quality of the unit is excellent and she recommend it to anyone else looking for netbook
if you re looking for something to fly through those massive spreadsheets or play graphics intensive game you be better off getting machine aimed at that segment of the market
previous laptops were pc still have them but the mac osx is clean and smooth operating system
still testing the battery life as thought it would be better but am very happy with the upgrade
probably as good as you can get in netbook does everything ask for and has some very good unexpected pluses
has met or exceeded my needs for compact travel device
so far so good
ve been impressed with the battery life and the performance for such small amount of memory
don understand why only windows starter is included
strong performance in this device makes use of fun and strong sense of the era of speed
this device serves all modern requirements is very strong game and is very useful for designers
enjoy that toshib force and durability unparalleled
needs longer lasting battery more than to hrs
needs power and mouse cable to plug in back instead of side in the way of operating mouse in small area
for the use it was purchased for it is good laptop
comfterbale to use light easy to transport
love this product because it is toshiba and its
it has no camera but can always buy and install one easy
had usb connect but can use it because it is not compatible
that the downside for me
but would recommend this product
satisfy what paid for it
good monitor and performed well
am using the external speaker sound is good
best thing is can use existing bit old programs
recommend for word processing and internet users
the games included are very good games
would highly recommend this one to my friends
bought this laptop because of the performance to price ratio
it works great for general internet use microsoft office apps home bookkeeping etc
it doesn have lot of frills but didn need any and being able to buy what needed and not more than needed was very important
this computer used daily nice compact design
excellent speed for processing data
and if you are game player it works with world of warcraft wonderfully
all in all great item highly recommend it
would have to say that overall its great
aside from the trial software and the short battery life lack of webcam its great
fast great visual
oh yea has no numeric pad on the side
nd best computer in the world only one way this computer might become the best is that it needs to upgreade patches to make less easier for people to hack into
my favorite part of this computer is that it has vga port so can connect it to bigger screen
great wifi too
the screen is little glary and hated the clicking buttons but got used to them
overall for the money this is good deal
there is no number pad to the right of the keyboard which is bummer
the speakers are terrible and are probably the cheapest ones have ever seen in laptop so if your planning to listen to music suggest you get something better
while the keyboard itself is alright the plate around it is cheap plastic and makes hollow sound when using the mouse command buttons
am overall very pleased with my toshiba satellite like the extra features love the windows home premium
the battery life has not decreased since bought it so thrilled with that
also love the design the looks the feel and the my toshiba feature is wonderfull
would easly reccomend this laptop to friend
couldnt not use it
tried to make recovey disk wouldnt get passed the first recovery disk
defective software
returned it to walmart
would like to have volume buttons rather than the adjustment that is on the front
also had problem with the touchpad that caused the mouse pointer to jump all over the screen
went to toshiba online help and found some suggestions to fix it
one of them seems to have worked
its good laptop for its value
registration st use is easy
features like the font are very block like and old school
would like more trendy high tech features
the start menu is not the easiest thing to navigate due to the stacking
keys stick periodically and havent had the laptop for days yet
came fully loaded good
seems to slow down occassionally but can run many applications ie internet tabs programs etc simultaneously
really impressed with the quality and performance for the price of the computer
graphics are clean and sharp internet interfaces are seamless
only issue is that it is little slow and fixing that by adding more ram
sound card is limited though
the laptop is very lightweight can easily carry around in knapsack full of text books and it barely adds any weight
it is small enough to fit in one of my purses
windows starter is terrific no you can change the background but don need to use it just for school work
the battery life is amazing the versitility is outstanding
the ease of set up was terrific
was even able to uninstall mcaffe and install one of my symantec licenses with no issues whatsoever
had to adjust my mousepad sensitivity because it is very sensitive
keyboard is great very quiet for all the typing that do
screen is crystal clear yes it small but it netbook
awesome laptop and the perfect size to carry around in college
couldn believe how long the battery lasted on single charge
loaded windows via bootcamp and it works flawlessly
simply amazing computer
really like the mac in notebook but its very pricey
love the graphics awesome programs including garageband and really cool default background
but like said before the only reason don currently have mac laptop is because all of their laptops are too pricey
waiting for the was well worth it great value for the price
bigger hd better graphics card and bid hd
there is nothing to complain about the system
have used pc and converting to this macbook pro was easy
if you have the money suggest going for the
occassionaly use it for work via vpn and it has not given me any problems
the screen is nice and the images comes very clear the keyboard and the fit just feels right
consider myself an average user and this computer serves my need
the price is another driving influence that made me purchase this laptop
ts nice to have the higher end laptops but this fits my budget and the features need
normally dont participate in reviews surveys but this laptop has not given me any problems and hope to share my thoughts
another satisfied customer
the apple macbook is the best investment that have ever made
the newer macbook that have purchased is one of the best computers
am college student and it has been very useful
it has all the features that are necessary for college and if not they are able to be added onto the computer
it has lot of memory and great battery life
it is sleek and lightweight and charges quickly when needed
its white color is stylish for college students and easy to take to carry and take to classes
iphoto is great for adding pictures right to facebook and other social networking sites
the internet capabilities are also very strong and picks up signals very easily
have never had to shut down the computer unexpectedly and the computer has never froze on me
the screen is bright and vivid and the keyboard is very easy to use very important for use quick typers
overall this is wonderful computer and definitly worth the purchase
the graphics are stunning
it wonderful for computer gaming
would definitely suggest this laptop
it is very user friendly and not hard to figure out at all
it has many great programs such as ilife iphotos and others
ilife is easily compatible with microsoft office so you can send and receive files from pc
in addition all the design tools on pages and keynotes makes it much easier to create professional looking documents and presentations
this comes in very handy for me as an educator
iphotos is an excellent program for storing and organizing photos
it allows you to automatically upload photos to your facebook account with one click
in addition there is photo detection software that will allow you to group all the photos together based upon the people in the picture
if you are looking for something reliable this is the laptop for you
this computer was awful
will never buy another computer from dell ever again do to how awful it worked and how was treated by the company
the computer first started malfunctioning months after purchasing it
it does not keep internet signals no matter where you bring it
the system it comes with does not work properly so when trying to fix the problems with it it started not working at all
when calling dell for help reurn or new computer they were not useful and left it up to myself to figure out what to do with it
one year of trying to fix the computer by myself with help of friends and even help from computer experts have given up on trying to fix it
this computer was awful would never recomend it to another person
those moments in thime where you want to throw something against the wall
yeah wanted to throw that lap top out the window and light it on fire
that how frustrating it was
it is so simple to use use it more than my desktop
it is well worth the money it cost very good investment
the new macbook pro inch is nothing short of amazing
the speed is incredible and am more than satisfied
bought from wal mart believe that this laptop was repaired item
this laptop was bad from the first day of use brought it back to store for return of money
now am very aprehensive about toshiba laptops
will not every buy another lou
this is great value for the money
this is great computer
we haven had any problems with it at all
the body is bit cheaply made so it will be interesting to see how long it holds up
overall though for the money spent it great deal
but let me tell you the mac book pro is so professional
its very nice and once you learn the features you will be so happy to have such sophisticated computer
for example when my husband turns the light out while on the computer the screen brightness automatically adjusts
it is very easy to type on and feels great besides the added feature that the keyboard is lighted
oh it is such great piece of equipment
its office compatible but the features and its functioning is all new again so you might as well save the money and just learn the pre installed mac programs
get ton of compliments on its size and speaking as someone who regularly commutes on bus can attest to the fact that this is the perfect size computer if you re restricted to the width of your body for computing room
very long life battery up to hours depending on how you configure power level settings
upgraded the memory and replaced the base windows starter to win home and it runs just fine
play lot of casual games online and the touchpad is very responsive
wouldn play first person shooter with this mind but if you wanted to run ms office email chat download video listen to music from certain fruit named music store and were looking for highly portable yet powerful netbook to do that all in highly recommend checking this out
the downside to this netbook is pretty much the same for any netbook screen size is not something stare at for the entire hours of battery life five days week
additional caveat the base installation comes with some toshiba specific software that may or may not be to user liking
everything from the design to the os is simple and to the point
love it love it love it
it really is perfect for work and play
am able to play and media files just fine with it
everything have tried has worked and never have to carry the wall charger cause the battery is so awesome
the only thing that isn perfect about this netbook is the speakers they are not loud at all but expected that
upgraded it ram to gb am very happy with it
lots of preloaded software
the only problem is that had to add gb ram the computer was kinda slow
tosiba has good reputation my llast computer was an acer
this is starting off good
what great little laptop
maybe not the cutting edge satellite but it is workhorse
bought it to use in college and it is perfect
dual boot with linux and that other security prone os and it performs flawlessly
made perfect decision when bought the toshiba
excellent product for the money
no problems no lock ups no disappointments
not super fancy but not super expensive either
highly recommend for daily use
the computer itself is good product but the repair depot stinks
have had to send in my laptop three times to get it fixed
toshiba does not send any one out unless you have paid extra to have the on site repair done
would tell the technician knew exactly what was wrong with it but they did not listen and had to go through bunch of junk to get them to tell me needed to send the computer in
this computer that have has had issues with the keyboard where it lost half the keyboard functions
as well as having the plug in the computer come loose
so having the ac plug go out on me and get lose or could actually here it inside my computer on two of the three times is not good
it still seems to be little lose now but so far seems to be hanging in there
the mac book pro performs flawlessly
never had single problem and don have to worry about viruses
while mostly use it for email internet and gaming confident all other applications live up to the high standard ve come to appreciate from mac laptops
worth the investment and truly fine piece of equipment
right out of the box this little netbook did everything asked of it including streaming the everyday video you re bound to encounter checking mail and websites my biggest complaint previously
it even has great webcam and skype works very well
the fact that you can spend over on just webcam underscores the value of this machine
the windows starter is in my opinion great way to think about using your netbook basics basics basics
wiped nearly everything off of it installed openoffice and firefox and am operating an incredibly efficient and useful machine for great price
this netbook is perfect supplementary computer to another laptop or desktop my wife and have another laptop or if you are user who uses the computer for simple tasks
use this for my tutoring business and since always bouncing from student to student it is ideal for portability and battery life yes it gets the hours as advertised
asus has done an outstanding job of evolving their netbooks and would recommend this to anyone who both understands their needs and how netbooks can fit them
little short on ram but you get what you pay for
the hinge design forced you to place various connections all around the computer left right and front
the headphone and mic jack are in front of touch pad making the touch pad hard to use when using headphones mic not to mention the laptop was designed for right handed person
cords coming out the right for power plus cords coming out front for headphones mic plus network connection on left make for very messy setup with cords going every direction
love windows but can give toshiba any credit for that unless all get serious about ergonomics and making required connections less obtrusive will be looking to different manufacturer next time
was happy with my purchase of toshiba satellite laptop until it came time to have it repaired under the toshiba warranty
the computer was shipped to their repair depot on june and returned on july seems like short turn around time except the computer was not repaired when it was returned
they were totally unconcerned that the computer was not correctly repaired in the first place
the computer is currently in west verginia doe to the method of shipping choosen by toshiba
the computer could have been shipped by priority mail through the usps for the same cost and arrived by noon on tue
instead it is sitting in west verginia waiting for ups to take two days to send me box and two days for them to ship the computer some miles by air to louisville ky
and toshiba is totally unconcerned
the reaction of toshiba is there is nothing you can do about it so just sit back and except the fact that you are powerless and it is mind over matter
we don mind and you don matter
would not recommend the purchase of this modle of toshiba computer or any toshiba product for that matter
when it come time for warranty service to toshiba you don matter
windows vista makes this computer almost unusable for online service
ve tried going back to xl but there still problems
the technical service for dell is so rd world it might as well not even bother
just bunch of idiots who english as th language is forced at best
all for saving money but dell needs to step it up
good price
basic computer
didn work when shipped from walmart com but went into store and exchanged for working laptop same make model
it has worked fine
handles all my basic media needs easily
can listen to my music and watch my videos with ease and with great display
it is speedy when connected wirelessly to any network regardless if the connection is weak or not
it great prodcut to handle basic computing needs
it has served my needs quite nicely for the most part
the gb of ram is plenty able to run windows and at least or other programs with next to no slowdown
my one complaint with this laptop is that ve noticed an electronic fuzz sound coming out of the headphone jack when headphones are plugged in
this is likely due to poor grounding and isolation between the components and hoping that it can be fixed with ground loop isolator but still expected better product quality for this price range
other than that would recommend this to someone in need of cheap laptop with semi decent gaming capabilities
let me start with the good so awesome
great os fabulous improvements to the existing line bumping up the processor speed and adding the thunderbolt port
this one has had the same effect
the improvements to the os have been relatively gradual but substantive
the unibody construction is solid sleek and beautiful
it is everything hoped it would be from look and feel standpoint but somehow bit more sturdy
for the not so good got the stock screen which is very glossy
it still beautiful and has better color reproduction than could ever expect from notebook
the reflectiveness of the display is only minor inconvenience if you work in controlled lighting environment like me prefer it dark or if you can crank up the brightness
the statement of hour battery life is not just mere exaggeration it lie
challenge anyone to show proof that through anywhere near normal use can get more than hrs out of it
the first full charge of this battery got me only about full hours
enabling the battery timer is useless
the time remaining goes from hours plus to less than hours over the span of about minutes
it so bad that thinking only got half battery or something
know what hrs of battery looks like
my only other complaint is that it gets really hot
if you buy this don go into it expecting hrs of battery life and you ll be perfectly satisfied
the pro is great product wish that the inch models came with the intel processors and had more comfortable edge the edges hurt my wrists
other than that its great performing machine and well meets all my needs and more
great product by apple with the new great looking design
actually had the hard drive replaced twice the mother board once the dvd drive twice then they finally agreed to replace it all of this in less than years only to get another hp compaq piece of crap
it was slow locked up and also had hardware replaced after only months
so buyers beware
it is made better thicker and all out tough
droped this once from thetable when my baby girl grabed me one day and it is still working with no issues
love the easy to see screen and it works well for work persoal or just play
tell everyone see out looking to get this or another toshiba
my friends or children use that when they need to borrow the net when out grow this meaning when its old and my oldest child is ready for one she will get this one and will be buying only toshiba
just love this lap top just wish it were all silver or they had all black
that is my only complaint
love this laptop wonderful price for what you get
would pay more for it if had too
recently purchased the mini and absolutely love it
it meets all my needs for work and pleasure while traveling
am totally satisfied with my little toshie
from the moment opened the box to the present it has been great joy
it is always reliable never bugged and responds well
love the operating system and the preloaded software
this machine delivers
it is also extremely pleasing to the eyes without looking too much like an alienware gaming machine
it is bit heavy
it would be load on long trips where lot of walking is required
had some trouble finding case that it would fit in
this is an over sized inch laptop
it wouldn fit in most inch bags
was disappointed when realized that the keyboard doesn light up on this model
it also does not have bluetooth
you ll need to upgrade and pay little more for them
was looking too closely at the other performance specs and while comparing took it for granted that these features were standard
overall still very nice machine
boots up fast and runs great
pleased
the acer one compuer is great computer
didn want to buy generic brand computer but it is really nice
its fast has high definition quality in the videos
the pictures are clear as can be
if had to buy another computer would most definetly buy an acer one computer
heck if had enough money would but it as gift for someone
im glad that it has such great features in it
it also came with built it web cam which is great because can see an communicate with my family members back home
clear picture on it and everything
the one down side to it is that when play certin game on here it tends to freeze up sometimes but thats the only bad thing about this computer
the acer one computer that bought is ince screen and its hard to find lap top bags for it but like the big screen on it
its good for playing my apps on facebook or watching movies
im very happy with this computer
it solid
love the stability of the mac software and operating system
the only downfall is lot of the software have won work with mac and iwork is not worth the price of it
it seems to be incompatible with everything else
but the machine is awesome and ilife is great and love snow leopard
love to use it it is esay and light
this laptop is durable and it is easy to travel with
needed one to be able to carry to work everyday and this one seems to fit all of the criteria
this laptop is great for work and doing my pictures
am huge computer person love anykind of computer that works well but when got this one was so happy with the way it works and how it runs its amazing
the programs are esay to use and are quick to process this computer works like charm
can use it for all of my needs
give this laptop five star review love it and it has done chams for me
if this computer every breaks down on me will most definatly get the same one again
think that anyone looking for good durrable laptop then this is the way to go
from the second you open the box you will fall in love with this computer
the os is still as fast as the day that the laptop was purchased and continues to run flawlessly
the track pad to me is what really stands out though you can do several different things with it just depending on how many fingers you use on the track pad awesome thinking apple
the os is also very user friendly even for those that switch from pc with little practice you can take full advantage of this os
apple continues to shine and provide much more enjoyable computer experience
from the start when you open the box you see completely different class of machine
the ease in which you set everything up is such that child could do it
the screen is bright and clear the operating system is solid and friendly to novice
fast fast and fast the web pages just fly by
had my iworks itunes email ms office network and printers set up and completely working perfectly within an hour
that includes transferring my music and movies
good bye blue screen and critical errors
skype is just so dang cool with this machine too
if your time is worth anything to you if you are tired of rebooting reformatting reinstalling trying to find drivers if you want computer to work for you for change make the change to this computer
it is light and the battery last very long time
very fast boot up and shut down
let me tell you this machine is great
purchased for development purposes but it has turned into my everyday laptop as well for surfing mail etc
thought learning the mac os would be hard but it is easily picked up if you are familiar with pc
the most amazing part to me as pc user is the startup and shutdown times and the fact that you very rarely have to restart the thing
the only time have restarted is during system updates
great machine if you want to drop the cash for one
ok this is probably the best laptop series ever devised by apple
the case is carved out of single block of aluminum
the processor screams and because of the unique way that apple osx functions most of the graphics are routed through the hardware rather than the software
have recommended this laptop to everyone know who is buying one
like it so much bought another just for my wife
took it back as it was defective
page just disapeared after you got yahoo or downloaded something
couldn keep page up you were working on
was great deal will give that
the laptop preformed pretty well
it cant fuction well with lots of webpages open at once
it has times were it freezes for seconds and then starts again
the mouse on the pad the left button always sticks
the mouse is way way way to sensitve
tried turning it done but it did nothing
the mouse jumps around all the time and it clicks stuff dont want it too
its not bad just very very annoying
think would spend little extra to get better made laptop
am very happy with this laptop
for the price and what get out of it has exceeded my expectations
always have used tower home pc and jumped to the laptop and have been very satisfied with its performance
amazing quality
plus stylish
the big screen allows you to enjoy watching movies pictures and etc
the flaws are this computer is not for computer gamers because of the os
mac is not made for gaming
but there this application called boot camp which allows you to add another os like windows
second it gets scratches easily and when it gets old some thing may operated
was not happy with one of the programs on it
it was not clear that the microsoft student edition that was loaded on the computer was six month trial
also the extended warranty was problem
the extended warranty for the and up computers was the only one available for purchase on the drop drown menu
overall the computer is very easy to use the screen is perfect great computer my daughter loves
finally decided on this laptop because it was the right price for what need it
did think it had camera because that was one of my requirements but forgot to check in the specifications on this one before purchased
so disappointed in that because communicating with my relatives out of the area is priority
just hope the reputation that toshiba has is true and won have to worry about crash
bought this emachines notebook pc in january of this year and am highly dissatisfied with it
the internet explorer was very slow from the very beginning
it freezes and it always shows that there is an error so have to restart it few times every time use it
tried to upgrade it to newer version couple of months ago and still have the same problem
well started using google chrome which is little better but it freezes too sometimes
this notebook restarts every time there is new update so if you don save your files and information everything will be lost
another issue have with it is the battery
maybe three or four months ago it started blinking all of the sudden
there is small red circle next to it with in the middle and when click on it it says consider replacing your battery and it does not hold full charge
it is not even year old yet so would definitely not recommend it to anyone
don waste your money
the laptop is gorgeous
it is sleek smooth and lightweight
it is easily portable and take it everywhere go and might require internet access
the screen is very large and crystal clear with amazing colors and resolution
the processor is very quick and effective as load webpages and applications
it is quiet and real joy to watch work
love it and will probably get another one when this goes to the laptop in the sky
overall this laptop is great
it has plenty of memory lots of hard drive and great graphics
it runs very quiet too which is plus
the only bad thing about it is they give you the worst batteries possible
they only stay charged little over an hour
laptops are usually used on the go so why not give you better battery
the processor amd semprom at ghz is bummer it does not have the power for hd or heavy computing
the notebook is lacking hdmi port and video port that would enable one to hook it to tv
it is cheap throw together
save your money and go for better device
this laptop is great price and has sleek look
runs smooth and quick
wish it had webcam though then it would be perfect
love my new computer
its fast and another thing like is that it has three usb ports
love to write and play with graphics and html programming and my new toshiba works great on both
thank you for your great product
everything about this computer is easy to use
wonderful features
the only thing is that the battery won last more than an hour
it discharges too quickly
kind of annoying but still love the laptop
it has good speed and plenty of hard drive space
the only downfall is the volume control
the wheel that turns the volume up and down doesn work in real time
have to keep turning it until it decides to lower and there is no mute
bought my macbook few months ago and it has been my baby ever since
love it so much
it has come into good use for my finances scheduling my parents business expenses and it is definitely amazing for gaming
the best thing is even while doing almost ten or twenty things at once it never slows down
it just as fast with one program open as it is with sixteen open
it works exactly like it did the day took it out of the box
great investment
the price and features more than met my needs
the feature are good enough for what need
love my macbook pro
my laptop is almost yrs old and have never had any problems with it
if you are pc user looking to convert would highly recommend it
it may take little getting used to but you don have to worry about viruses or other headaches
not to mention the fact that your mac comes fully loaded with all necessary basic programs
am addicted to photo booth
it is so much fun to play with
work with kids and they love making short videos on there
am able to organize my pics music and files easily
if you have any creativity in you do yourself favor and get mac
love the keyboard
the display is awesome
only thing would want to add to this is an internal bluray read write drive
but other than that am blown away by all the features this laptop offers
think this computer is super lame
dont understand how anyone can think this is great product worth purchasing
decided to get this pile of crap on whim and totally freaking regret it
it doesnt work worth damn
the display is beyond horrible
can not even read what am writing half of the time
there are so many things wrong with this product it just makes me want to set my self on fire
would totally recommend any other laptop over this pile of grabage
not to mention it has shit gigs
could not even put my entire music collection on this garabage
do yourself favor and invest in few external harddrives if you are planning on purchasing this laptop
bought this last week and the very next day had to return it because it over heated and the touch mouse stopped responding
got another and same issue
am taking back today
don waste your money or time
very dissappointed becase have had toshibas for years and never issue
stopped booting up less than week after my one year warranty was up
toshiba knows there is manufacturing defect but will not acknowledge it
apparently there is manufacturing defect something with the amount of thermal paste
toshiba will not acknowledge this problem
when called toshiba they would not do anything and even tried to charge me for the phone call even though they didn offer any technical support
loved the netbook minus the fact that it was windows os until this started happening
but if you can make your product last more than year you will not get my business again
ve had my macbook pro for three years now and still love it
in those three years ve had couple of minor problems and both were resolved by apple quickly and easily
my power supply cord developed exposed wires within the first year of ownership so it was covered by the applecare warranty plan
in the three years ve had my macbook pro have never had virus on my computer and do lot of work on the internet
the ilife software that comes with the computer is so simple to use and produces great finished product
highly recommend this product
needs constant repair
first the screen goes completely out
then hp sends it back to me with the hardware screwed up not able to connect
now the screen is going darker darker darker
hp is more interested in selling extended warranties which cost more than the netbook new then they are in helping or fixing
oh yeah don forget the expensive shipping to and from hp
spent as much for shipping as would to buy new netbook of course different brand
so far so good with this laptop
fan vents to the side so no cooling pad needed great feature
screen is crystal clear and the system is very responsive
memory is upgradable
the only thing would change about it is the mouse keys
they click
sounds like typewriter but if you can get past that this is great laptop for little money
hate this one
vista is nightmare
no tutorials on the display
the book is useless
the machine has bluray player the book has no mention of it or how to connect it to your hdtv
thinking about returning it
the macbook is fantastic laptop
you will love this macbook if you choose to buy it
the macbook rarely requires hard reboot
it just works flawlessly
its hard to encounter problem on mac that would require such abrupt action
honestly love my mac thats why am self proclaimed mac addict
this was purchased for my daughter and was pleasantly surprised
it had the full sized touch pad with buttons instead of just one
it made the computer much easier to use and navigate
keyboard was also very nice and had solid feel
this system came loaded with windows starter
so far so good
when got this laptop in to help me with school had hard time from beginning
feel that it was poorly put together because once in while different plastic pieces would come off of it
quite simply this is the best laptop have ever owned
for me five stars is not enough
love the macbook pro
my parents bought it for me as graduation gift and totally almost kind of maybe definitely obsessed with it
it was very easy to just pick up and use
it did not take long to get used to the mac os
love the size because the screen is big enough for what use it for internet artwork and yet it is small enough to be reasonably portable
there are several programs for school or office use pages numbers keynote etc music garageband photo management photo booth iphoto video editing or movie making imovie etc
the built in webcam is great for skype and similar video chat services
itunes is handy music management program and it is essential for anyone with an ipod
all in all would definitely recommend this product for nearly everyone
love it
they definitely have superior product
its not just slow on the internet its slow in general
no am generous calling it slow
its more like snail crawl
he can stand it
can begin to say how disappointed am
should have spent an extra hundred bucks and got full sized computer
the key bindings take little getting used to but have loved the macbook pro
delivery was early too
it allows me to do everything need from computer and more
with awesome graphics and assuring security it perfect
recommend this laptop to anyone
the toshiba satellite laptop is designed to fail
the board has bad connector with the power supply and shortly after warrenty expires the power supply will start having issues
toshiba is aware of the issue but unless the extended warrenty is bought toshiba will do nothing about it
actually contact toshiba before started having problem and was given run around after supplied serial number in order to delay me sending in laptop until after warrenty expired
then after paying for it to be examined was told it was same problem cited on website but have to pay anyways since it was past warrenty
it has far exceeded my expectations for power storage and abilitiy
it is easy to navigate and update programs
ve never had problems with viruses
my next laptop will also be mac
would like to tell you about the best laptop just got from mac
my mac laptop is fabulous in both areas
it gives me the power and speed that need to run all the programs use to edit
the final cut pro on this laptop is so fast and easy and can use this to seemlessly transfer all my work to my home computer which is also mac
would buy one of these for every person in my office if could
in my line of work often have to take work home and this makes it so easy
do transcription work on the side and the flatline keyboard makes typing quick and easy as well
the apple care has never failed me and expect it to be the same for this computer as well
will only buy apple laptops from now on
great laptop for school easy to use for beginners in the household
keyboard is great but primary and secondary control buttons could be more durable
battery life could be better but overall for the price and toshiba reputation for laptops it great
my macbook pro has been huge disappointment
from the build quality to the performance everything about it has been sub par from what would have expected from apple
the system constantly overheats the battery life is too short the case is coming apart and my core applications that use every day in my work as graphic artist run poorly
would not recommend this product to anyone
screen is awesome battery life is good
really like the textured surface which shows no fingerprints
good laptop for the money
speakers don get that loud but good enough
they don crash
if website ever freezes which is rare its really easy to force quit
never been hacked
no viruses
have had to call with few questions or issues and they have helped me for free even without the warranty
mac is very easy to use and it simply makes sense
its also fun to use
the programs are great like iphoto love the editing capabilities imail which can incorporate with the address book on the ipod and ipad imovie etc
she said its very user friendly
however love this particular mac because its very fast great size and has fantastic features like the lighted keyboard and easy mouse pad
am very happy bought this mac well worth the extra money
now that have it see that really needed this for much more
run dreamweaver final cut pro photoshop safari firefox msn messenger and few other applications constantly at the same time
have not had problem with the applications quitting or freezing
highly recommend this laptop to anybody that wants great performance from laptop and would like to relax and not become enraged cursing the gods about to throw your laptop out the door
that was my first apple product and since then have been incredibly happy with every product of theirs have bought
my macbook pro is no exception
since ve had this computer ve only used the trackpad because it is so nice and smooth
also like that you can scroll down in window using two fingers on the trackpad
the computer runs very fast with no problems and the ilife software that comes with it iphoto imovie iweb itunes garageband is all very helpful as well
would recommend this laptop to anyone looking to get new laptop who is willing to spend little more money to get great quality
shiny
this laptop is the best of the best
the awesomest of the awesomest
it is so great can hardly ever take my hands off it
my friends are in awe every time they come over
got it for christmas and was so excited to set it up
it is super fast and always loads
am just amazed
the only bad part is the size weight
it like punds but if you can look past it it great
if you don like fingerprints this might not be the laptop for you
it super shiny so you can see the fingerprints easily
all for such great price
it color is even cool
another great thing is the beast graphics
they are so realistic am just speechless
let my friend borrow it and she knows nothing about computers and she used it with ease
the cool thing about this is anyone can use it
don know how could ever live without my qousmio
own hewlett packard laptop and ve had man problems with it since bought in in feb
ive had to call tech support many times
each time taking about day or so
had to wait weeks to get it back and it still is not working properly
had to pay for the shipping
will never buy anything from hp again
the toshiba satellite has been more than expected for the price
this computer may be small but it is one heck of power horse
you can do it all on this bad boy but the main thing this netbook was desinged for was surfing the web and boy boy does it ever
for being so small it is amazing that it is as fast as it is
when first got it thought the size of it was joke
but after got used to it love it
the size of has actually help me out quite bit by me being able to fit it in an already full backpack and to use it at resturant where the food on the table is always so space consuming
it has usb ports sd memory card reader and an sd memory car expansion
the only down fall is that it has no cd drive but found that they are very cheap to by and also very portable making this the best friend to someone who is always looking for more space then they have
overall would recomend this to anybody and tell them that if they want to burn their music or play there video games to buy the cd drive
use my mac all the time love the software the way it takes short time to load things how easy it is to use and most of all how you don have to worry about viruses
with mac you don have to worry about antivirus software or firewall it so wonderful
all apple associates are always wiling to help you out with anything no matter when you purchased the computer and how many years passed
this computer will last you at least years thats an amazing life spanned an electronic
everything about mac is wonderful it takes little used to learning and getting used to the new system but you will learn fast and its all worth it
not working bad
spent dollars on top of the line laptop
got the blue screen of death the first month got it
payed for premium laptop
blue screen first month
horrible customer support they lost my laptop for month got it back months later
laptop still did not work blue screen within week
cut my losses and sold it for parts
this company truely does make horrible products and doesnt seem to because they are certain things like this never happen
what an elegant wonderful machine
making the switch and finding that my biggest problem is trying to do things the old way and apple does indeed have the better idea
really wish had done this years ago
pairing it with an iphone is pure pleasure talk about painless syncing used to take me forever now it snap
love it never had computer was so impressed with and ve had lot of laptops and desktops this one is far and above the best one ever had before
tell everyone that know friends family and enemies this is the absolute worst computer have ever used
the computer blinks it shuts off at will
the letter stopped working after the first week
when called to have another one shipped or to get my money back they said the return policy is twenty three days from the date of purchase
so the fact that the computer does not work on the twenty fourth day is my fault
they have done absolutely nothing to fix the computer problem
they have not sent new one nor called
spent eight hundred dollars from giant paper weight that looks good on bus
then on top of it all their cusromer service center is in the middle east
so when you do call to complain about the hunk of metal you get the joy of speaking with bunch of people you cant understand
then to make matters worst there is noone that they can transfer you to
had this computer for one month and had to send it in for repair
got the computer back month later and it was still broken sent it out again and they repaired it
weeks went by and the computer keeps crashing and will not open any applications
do not buy gateway computers they are junk and the warranty company is horrible
you will not be able to talk to an american warranty service is out of country
computer has been at service facility more than in my hands
have had this laptop for few months now and would say im pretty satisfied
the only problems are the sound isnt very loud have to wear headphones
another thing is that after only month the left mouse key broke and it costed to send it in to fix it
that whole experience was just ridiculous we sent it in and after they told us that we had to pay to fix it we were like we will just by portable mouse which would be way cheaper but they refused to send the laptop back until we paid the and it was fixed
it took little over weeks until got it back
and babyed the heck out of it just one day when opened it turned it on went to click and it was broke
to be honest think it was faulty equipment or something but idk
the graphics are great
the internet speed is spectacular
the battery life is probably an hour at best
oh and it has word and stuff but its trial verion so after about month or so when you go to open it it asks for product key which didnt come with the computer and even after clicking cancel it wont let you use it at all use the old word processer which works good
would recommend it just because of the internet speed probably because thats the only thing really care about
wish the volume could be louder and the mouse didnt break after only month
received this laptop as gift and let me just tell you that its the worst
at first it worked well for month or so then the system board failed and send it in to toshiba some complaints and three weeks later then receive my laptop back only to discover that it still has the same problem so now have to send it back again to get it fixed again
this computer doesn do that well with certain games it can play some and it becomes too hot while playing games
oh and if thats not bad enough it doesn come with recovery cd so you can make one if you know how to or buy one if you buy it the cost is for two cds
the whole experiece is horrible so save up and buy better laptop
bought hp pavilion dv nr laptop and have had so many problems with the computer
the computer is so slow even after paying staples the extra money to speed it up
they said it was computer error on this type of computer
also have alot of trouble with it getting very hot and not even sitting on anything to make it hot
when the computer has been on for several minutes it will occasionaly just go off by itself
also the battery does not last very long at all
would recommend not buying this product
have had no luck with staples or hp to resolve this problem
am stuck with laptop that cannot do very much with
also have had alot of trouble with the keys sticking and will not type correctly
also have had alot of trouble with the shift key to go to other lines
it gets stuck all of the time you use it and you have to keep tapping on it to get it to work
sometimes the screen even goes black on this computer
will probably never buy hp again
purchased toshiba lap top it worked good until just after the warrenty went out
after the warrenty expired the hard drive went bad and it would have cost more to fix then to replace
hate it
have had the luxury sarcasm of owning of these laptops
the first fell apart right after the year warranty
during that time had to send it back times
paid about for this laptop because of all the bells and whistles and it kept crapping out on me
none of the techs at hp knew what they were doing
they would repair one thing send it back and it would still have the same problem
the processor went on me the fan went and the motherboard went
wanted to purchase the extended warranty and they refused because they knew it was trouble
had something else go wrong and they said it had to be in good working order to be able to buy the warranty
took it to friend who temporarily fixed it and finally paid about for the extended warranty
sent it back and they lost it
waited and waited and no laptop
finally after months of research the discovered that they mailed it to walmart and there probably would be no way to find the box
waited another month for approval and for them to build me new laptop
here we are another year later and the computer is doing the same thing
hp didn fix it
swear they design these things to go to crap after year so you are stuck and have to buy new one
in months the connect quality got worse and worse
st time they got it working the next month they had me send it in
returned it
months dead again
they say sorry out of warranty
summary they played games with me for the warranty period
now months later they want would not say exact amount to to fix the machine
they had me send in the machine last april returned it to me in may with no documentation on what was done it anything
now the machine won connect and toshiba says that they did replace the connection card in may but they only warranty the repair for days and now out of warranty even though this has been constant month occurance since bought the netbook
so buyer beware when buying toshiba
they are wonderful but very dangerous when it comes to emitting heat
burned my leg after lifting it from my desk and for less than second putting it on my lap to clean my coffee table so can place it there
had to call apple times each time to minutes on the phone and take it to their store for evaluations and diagnostics times
for my burn thigh which has put permanent mark on my skin it happened months ago they offered me an itouch gig you know it is bit insulating when company this rich offer loyal customer like me bottom of their product line as gift for events like this
steve jobs probably needs help and donations and cannot afford reasonable offers for people that truly are trying to support his baby
the lesson learned here is it does not pay to by this loyal to any brand since all of them are there to simply to make as much money as possible as fast as they can and in this day and age the customer no longer is right all the times
am not going to sit here and complain about it not having cd drive and what not because it is netbook it is made to be compact and if you want all the other stuff get laptop
anyways bought this two months ago and when first brought it home it kept giving me message about vibration in the hard drive and it is putting it temporaly in save zone
so called customer support which is good too and they went through it and it is just safety feature and it does not affect performance at all just chose to hide the message
also the speakers are not very loud but it is netbook
would highly recommend this netbook though
custom ordered the machine from hp and could not understand the techie due to his accent
the computer was two weeks late in delivery because hp forgot to complete the required import paperwork
my laptop cost approximately and died after only years months and days of use
although my model was listed as recalled hp denied my claim
this laptop leaves alot to be desired have had it only months and have had to send it away to be repaired twice
bought it from hsn because it was bundled with extra software but as it turns out that software just crashes it more often
if you shop around in the current market you can find much better deal
the repairs were made quickly though must say however the second time they shipped it to the incorrect address and it took nearly week for them to get it to me
unable to boot up this brand new laptop
spent hours on phone with hp technical support
they went through asking me open up various components taking battery out hard disk apart and after hours on phone could not fix it
they are asking me to ship the unit back to fix it at their site
am going to go back and return at store bought from
this computer had exactly the specifications needed
small enough to use on long flight light enough to carry through airports and powerful enough to replace my desktop while on long business trips
the perfect notebook
when finally had everything running with all my software installed plugged in my droid to recharge and the system crashed
the aspire wont even boot past the acer screen with droid have tried both motorola and htc plugged into the usb port
called tech support and got the usual acer we don support software but for we can help you explained there was no software involved in booting
no tey don even support their own bios and it could be problem with the bios how can company that makes fairly decent product get away with such insanity
needless to say pc that can support cell phone is less than useless
with today company fighting over marketshare its shame that asus can get away with the inept staff answering thephone
agree with the previous comment that asus tech support is horrible which is con in my opinion
summary ve had this laptop for months out of the blue the power adapter stops working
but no one could tell me when my part would be shipped nor could they tell me where to buy it on their website
frustrated hung up and tried to call back days later to be told that it takes days for turnaround time
this was the rd day and part still had not been shipped
the rep did not even answer my question had to ask him if he understood what ask or if he spoke english because he didn even try to acknowledge my question
tired of the inept service
if you are looking for netbook pc do not buy from asus
unless you want to be inconvenienced with non working power supply which you can find replacement for because they made the attachment so small
really frustrated by this experience
how does the power supply not work
our apple macbook pro notebook computer notebook and has become such an integral part of completing our daily needs and social networking
do everything on this computer check email facebook shop check blogs write papers listen to music and we even watch all of our movies on it since we do not have tv
it pretty much does everything we could ever need and looks great to boot
apple is always great about the aesthetics of things they always come up with good looking products
it didn take me long to get switched over to the mac computer programs and navigation it been just fine and like the way this laptop functions much better
so if you re thinking of laptop would heartily recommend theapple macbook pro notebook computer notebook for all your needs
it great and we will always stick with apple computers we have been so happy with them
the macbook pro is portable durable and very capable
it has hour battery life when you re doing web browsing and word editing making it perfect for the classroom or office and in terms of gaming and movie playing it ll have battery life of just over hours
it also very energy efficient running on quarter of the power it takes to run watt lightbulb
it graphics aren bad at all for the lower end of the macbook pro spectrum easily capable of running starcraft ii and other games with comparable graphics
the operating system and user interface is very intuitive and the large multi touch track pad is amazing
however the multi touch gestures and large tracking area make having an external mouse unnecessary unless you re gaming
still this laptop is perfect for all day use at school and work
they also have longer service life than other computers have several friends who still use the older apple powerbooks
probbly the worst decision we ever made
it has bein into the shop to get new hardrive times and to fix the touch control buttons on the keyboard
pretty much everything else about the computer is good it just stops working out of no were
love the size of the computer since play games on it
also love having the extra calculator number set up on the keyboard which most laptops do not have
also the keyboard does not liht up so unless your sitting in room with some light you cant see anything and thats bad for me because my boyfriend tends to watch tv in the dark at night which leaves me with no way of seeing the keyboard
so would not reccomend anyone buying this computer
first it does not have push button to open the lid
it is held in place magnetically
there is little indent to help open it but good luck with that
once open the leading edge is razor sharp
this is the complete opposite to an ergonomic design
using this machine is like mild form of torture
the much lauded combined touch pad and clicker is nightmare
lost two items was working on until figured out what was happening
also the space bar makes noisy click every time you use it
hate to say this but if could take this back to the shop and get my money back then would
it is absolutely horrible to use despite all its so called advanced features
regret buying it before understanding how awful it is to use
it bummer and one out of five is being kind
my mac has gone from being trusted friend to an adversary
in due course ll remove the hard disc from this new macbook pro and dump it where it belongs in the trash
but the screen size is not that bad for email and web browsing
like this machine because its very lightweight
very convenient when you travel and the battery life is excellent
hours of battery life is really something else
highly recommend that you buy this product
it crashes and when it goes flat it just dies like pc maybe worse and loose all my open documents
hate it
it is the easiest computer have ever used
love it
can say enough good for it
it mac
fine apple mc ll ghz macboook pro notebook meets all my needs for laptop computer when on the go
like to use it at the race track to handiecap the horse races
it face and depanable
as graphic arts retired instructor still love to play with the graphic with photos and clip art
it just great toy to have around
very very slow laptop
tons of bloatware and junk programs
can reinstall with standard os cd because of proprietary hardware drivers
keys are all in weird places and is way too large for the way it is designed
lots of extra space but the keyboard is ridiculously small
amazing machine
it is big big but since it has screen what would you expect
it is truly desktop replacement
very fast and efficient
does great job with video shot on canon mkii
very happy with my th toshiba laptop
the touchpad is very intuitive so much so that never want to use buttons to click again
of course also have several great software packages that came for free including iwork garageband and imovie
especially appreciate the fact that it has almost zero viruses and spyware problems
the only drawback for me is how dirty the screen gets and rather quickly too
also enjoy the fact that my macbook pro laptop allows me to run windows on it by using the vmware program
now have the best of both worlds with all of the power and ease of the mac
also got the added bonus of hd monitor which really helps to extend my screen and keep my eyes fresh
never have had good result with this computer
was told by many that it was great computer but we got one of these and it worked great for one year and as soon as the warrenty was up then it got really bad
they told me it was my loss even though it was the computer not what ve done
the hard drive crashed as well and had to buy new power cord
they told me to reprogram the computer and didn need to do that and lost pictures of my oldests first years of her life
don like this company nor the toshiba brand and ll never buy another one because ve put more into it then it is worth
would rather spend my money on computer that costs more then toshiba that isn good at all
the right speaker did not work
again the same problem the right speaker did not work
returned the nd laptop for full refund
the mouse pad and buttons are the worst ve ever seen
sometimes you will be moving your finger and the pointer will not even move
the mouse buttons are hard to push
cant believe hp put this out
do not buy you will be disappointed
returning mine
dell is decently made pc
the graphics are awful and the wireless switch it at the top rather than the side which am used to it being on the side
with the switch being at the top you need to memorize the key combination rather than just flicking switch
so in brief summary would have to say that would not recommend dell vostro to anyone due to it being down right awful setup so in my opinion you should steer clear of them if you want decent laptop
love hp it the only computer printer we will buy
this is perfect for her field
at first when got this product loved it
the computer itself was fast ran smoothly and had no problems
then within months the charger crapped out on me
so called compaq and after being on the phone for hours finally got replacement which shouldn have had problem getting since it was under warranty
months later the battery went
they gave me hard time yet again but their was malfunction in the battery itself it didn die
then one month after the warranty expired the replacement charger went
had to pay for universal charger for this cheap laptop
not worth it one bit
the people are frustrating to work with the product itself is very cheaply made and the accessories are less than satisfactory
also my sister got the exact same laptop since they were so cheap and after months the screen split in half just from everyday use
apparently under the screen there are little screws and when the screen gets moved back and forth they come loose
and it is impossible to get them back in
strengths well shaped
weaknesses bad videocard
after min the screen of the notebook switched off
it was still working but there was nothing on the screen
was said it videocard
very disappointed
didn expect to repair it at once
don buy this model
an absolutely hateful machine that no one should get of their own free will
mine came at dvd burner
the screen is framed by half to full inch margin that is obviously unnecessary reduces the screen size and increases the bulk
the usb ports are nice but the two on the side only work now and then
keyboard could use some trimming
did mention everything about it from size to weight to keyboard screams bulk
glad made the choice to switch and buy this mac
the benefits were immediate
awesome graphics
the magnetic plug in power charging power cord is great even put it to the test by accident excellent innovation
this laptop rocks only wish it could run solidworks cad which apple doesn support
ve saved lot of time and headaches so far using my new macbook pro
have never had any issues or problems with my macbook pro so far and it is still as fast as it was when first bought it
especially like the backlit keyboard
it makes doing schoolwork at night so much easier
it is also very lightweight making transporting this computer very easy
the graphics on this computer are also stellar very clear and vivid
use iphoto all the time which is great program for anyone who is into photography amateurs and experts alike
the program came with the computer and works beautifully
definitely will buy mac again if and when this computer ever fails
my hp dx died after only months
it started out getting hot after only few months
at months it started shutting off after only or minutes
use cooling pad but it doesn help
took it to the shop and they said it would cost too much to repair it
will have to say that love my macbook pro
it fires up in the morning in less than seconds and have never had any issues with it freezing
this is now my rd macbook pro and really honestly love it
the macbook pro is very sturdy and versatile
love it
even got my teenage son one because of the features that it offers like ichat photobooth garage band and more
we are addicted to the mac
this is great laptop and would recommend it to anyone
the os takes some getting used to especially after being windows user for so long but the learning curve is so worth it
great laptop that offers many great features
lightweight and the screen is beautiful
it is easy to operate and have already ordered more software and gadgets for my new rolls royce of laptops
buy it love it and promise you won regret it
this computer is good for days then it sucks for the rest of your life
you will regret it if you buy any dell
dell sucks
the only pro to this computer is it was under
everything is falling apart internally and externally
with in weeks of purchasing my computer is began to slow down
am constantly trying to uninstall programs clean cookies and delete unused files
nightly my computer defrags itself and runs virus scan
more times that not the screen pops up saying have bad internet connection or the page can be displayed
it takes me approximately tries to get to each site then after closing the browser and reopening it it actually works
have vista so am unable to install and uninstall some programs
can even install one of the printers have in my house so am unable to print
externally the keys on my keyboard are falling off after few uses the paint is rubbing off the button below the mouse pad and where the heals of my hands sit and the screen has terrible glare
in short would never buy compaq again
bought this laptop on saturday and am completely in love with it
it was super easy to set up and is really easy to get used to
the online tutorial videos make it super easy to learn if you have always used pc
the performance is awesome
will never complain about the price since believe you get what you pay for and my macbook pro was worth every dollar
with all the goodies inside this machine it is value
it is very well built
the keyboard is top notch
the touch pad is among the best
the screen is huge and coloful but no led backlighting
the video card is great for media and above average for gaming but not gamers first choice
the problem had with this unit was unresolvable
it had cooling system malfunction after minutes of general use and would not move past this error
acually believe the issue is with the nvidia grafics card but still requires return
sorry toshiba but st impressions do count for something
got the black macbook two years ago and have never regretted it
so this was great for me
it has just enough ram to run smoothly and enough memory to satisfy my needs
plus it is small and reasonably light so can take it with me to and from work
also travel with it and it never gives me any problems
but am glad to have gotten mine right before they stopped making it
look forward to years of use it has held up well over the years and it fits my needs very well
the difference is the toshiba had lot more memory and hard drive space
it super fast and great value for the price
would definitely recommend checking out this laptop if you are in the market for one
month later we reinstall the os vista
coupla months later they change my hard drive
month or so ago the freaking motherboard just died
went silently
one night turned the freaking thing off after using it the next day turn it on no gui screen all dark power light steady hard drive light steady and not flashing as it usually does
the motherboard is dead
and still paying the bloody financing for product which didn last me at least three years
initially purchased my macbook pro in april and loved it
was so happy with my new mac
then the hard drive failed
my information was all lost my fault know but never thought would need to back up my information on brand new mac the paragon of all computers
so after apple replaced the hard drive enjoyed another months of my new computer until it froze this morning completely
can even turn it off
it catatonic
even if apple replaces whatever needs replacing wonder if since seem to be doubling the amount of time get out of it each time it like new might have months next time
would rate this computer at stars but considering it has short life span can only give it and implore anyone looking at laptops to stay away from this machine
great battery speed display
it works
my house is now macbook
the macbook starts fast doesn crash has fantastic display is small and light have the model and isn always complaining about updates lost connections errors blue screens etc
this is what laptop is supposed to be
thought the price was great for the specs
but after using it couple of weeks the overall operation is poor
hate the display screen and have done everything could do the change it
the keyboard is too slick
really don like it but am stuck
dell latitude is not reliable machine
the battery never held charge longer than one hour and within two months stopped holding charge for more than ten minutes
later it held zero charge and its replacement worked for less than three months
the machine is slow to boot up and occasionally crashes completely
very disappointing
was not aware that this product cannot display websites that contain flash
web access through the network is so slow it very frustrating and very disappointing
after purchasing this thing find out that need special interface device to connect my camera and that it cannot be purchased at the store only on line
hp pavilion dv notebook pc when first got this computer it really rocked
but as time went on found it almost impossible to keep the thing on line through wi fi
eventually the screen went blank and the computer would not turn on
guess ll stay away from hp
my macbook is probably the best investment have ever made
have had it for almost four years now and have only had few problems with it
the most recent being that my safari internet browser is freaking out on me but have just been using firefox instead
love this computer
its small enough where can take it pretty much anywhere but still has big enough screen to get everything done
the only thing that don like about my mac is that sometimes there are programs that want to be able to run and am not able to
games being the main issue
it drives me crazy when want to download game or something of that nature and can play it because its not compatable with the software
other than that don have one complaint in the world
this computer periodically crashes office iphoto safari
it takes long time to get on the web and to change web sites
locks up she searching for updates
it seems that this computer might be lemon
purchased my macbook pro retina from my school since had student discount but would gladly purchase it from amazon for full price again if had too
the retina is great its amazingly fast when it boots up because of the ssd storage and the clarity of the screen is amazing as well
but if you buy this would highly recommend that you buy case and screen protector for this machine as they are known to be quite fragile
count me as extremely satisfied it perfect computer
just bought this computer from the apple store and couldn be more impressed with it
it has stunning retina display and is very fast
this computer is good for anything and it has really superseded my high expectations
also the sound quality from the speakers is crystal clear and everything is just sleek and smooth
the hd display is sensational and now watching any movie is very enjoyable experience for me
no hardware issues as is common with any apple product
great product and couldn be happier with it
awesome laptop love it
love my new thinkpad
it gives me everything need from computer and with the long lasting battery it also gives me mobility
can use it anywhere
it was great purchase
all the sturdy and substantial feel you expect from thinkpad
average performance on almost every benchmark but priced accordingly
below average on the fi adapter which still trying to get to the bottom of
great laptop
fast
works very well
would purchase again
good value for the money
quite pleased with it
fast enough for my purposes
no bloatware from third party parasites to uninstall
excellent keyboard and crisp screen
battery could be better but it has robust processor and plenty of ram so that is trade off suppose
glad to have it and it showed up in only few days
the laptop itself is very good it could be better but not bad at all for it price point
it does everything need
the big deal with this was windows
when saw this grabbed it
it has met all my needs
just what expected
don have any complains about this computer
outstanding laptop and very well built
the retina display is fantastic
one of the best thing have bought in years
great pc light and powerful
is just amazing
the glare of the glossy retina display is unbearable
do not buy mac until this issue is resolved
performs as advertised if not better
super light weight never cared either way about weight until now
feels like solid state
wonderful machine
glad bought it
tiny forgivable drawback no ethernet cable outlet
but that not deal breaker
super laptop
will probably get another one for my wife
bit ugly but works good
like the design rather sleek and light
will give advise any prospective buyers this is not great laptop its good for web browsing and word processing
fantastic for the price just wish it the keys were illuminated
if your on budget save up longer
this laptop isn worth single cent
couldn even install linux on it
windows runs very poorly
just save your money and get something better
awesome price for laptop that lasts more than hours without recharging
awesome
this laptop is complete cheap junk
by just looking at it you will realize it crap
it not what you pay for
the case is made from cheap plastic
in the description it said there is bluetooth but no there isn
warning you you re wasting your money on this
love the computer
hate windows
it dosn even have disc compartment
had to return the computer
keeps freezing
no ethernet outlet
disc drive will not open or function
odd unusual dell commands
would have exchanged instantly but had to use as if for college immediately
unimpressed
terrific laptop
works beautifully
great price
just what we needed for our daughter to do her on line math class
this is great home computer
it is very very quiet
the only reason didn give it star is feel have to reach so far to type on the key board
you also have to press firmly on the keys
otherwise this is great computer great prices
was easy to set up and has been easy to learn to use it
works good and is fast enough for me
good product for good price
it was too cheaply constructed
it also gave me an introduction to windows which hope will be discontinued it the future
the computer is horrible its to slow
the thing that you insert cds into won open
not good computer at all
we returned two days later
they were excellent to handle our return and post our refund back into our account the next day
great price and computer
they loved it
it easy to operate and it very light my parents are almost yo they can carry heavy computer while traveling
but here something hadn realized before buying it there isn an optical drive which means no cds or dvds
this product was doa
fired up and worked for the first day and then the display died on my wife while she was taking timed test
would not recommend
pretty good laptop
good for basic stuff
don try to use to play any pc games or anything
just for simple web browsing and media streaming
pretty premium feel for the low price
have so much trouble turning the computer on
it comes on for seconds then shuts itself off
my mistake was to not research this one no dvd and no place to insert my ad card to download pictures
should have waited to find higher quality computer
very happy this laptop is beatifull is nt slow at all
but it doesn have cd unit anyway the other thing is that the laptop does not have an ethernet port for cable connecting
just wifi
the screen is big and everything was as described
for everyday use you can really go wrong with this laptop
if like me you will be paying bills occasionally reading the news or just buying stuff on line then this is winner
if you are gamer or need it for heavy computer use get something else
it good starter computer that is extremely light on the wallet
like said good for basic stuff and as starter
still getting use to window
has built in camera which do not use
sturdy but only for typical wear and tear
can not believe the price
amazing computer perfect for school
ve had my lenovo for little over month now and it does everything want it to do and more
really have nothing negative to say about it
the keyboard is little wonky with having to use the function button to get the keys but with how infrequently use those it is non issue
it is great value for what you get
can run somewhat modern games like skyrim and fallout new vegas with no issues
get giddy every time use this thing
it is thing of beauty and fast enough
when you click and don wait
so yes it is ridiculously fast
the battery will get you from la to ny no problem
the way different than my other computer so we have to get use to it
it is very light and the picture is nice and the price was amazing
can even readmy kindle on this computer
excellent item shipped on time met my expectations it doesnt heat at all dont use it for gaming
for the price this is super product out of the box
it wont wow you with its speed but who can complain at
plus this computer comes with full size keyboard
no junkware
this computer is great for someone who is looking to manage their online life banling facebook etc and some basic offline work using ms office
the only drawback is no dvd player but for you can buy an external one
very light and beautiful
it just little slow
five starts
terribly slow
start up time took forever everything runs very slowly
screen broke month outside warranty
overall build quality is cheap
avoid acer
not bad
nice and light seems to help your work instead of becoming work itself
perfect size for me
probably not gaming machine which have zero interest in
just love this ultrabook
defenitly recommend it for anyone for office and home work
it ok
find that it often gets very slow and have to restart more than usual
it light and easy to use though
love this computer this is my first ever mac and it took little while to switch over from the os was used to but it was fast learning curve
the resolution is gorgeous the computer is light it does everything need and the interface is pretty intuitive
love this computer
however am very upset that it doesn have the superdrive built in
supper east to use
retina display is beautiful
also very quick laptop
con hate that it has no disk drive
am also glad it doesnt get too hot when left on for an extended period of time
the battery life is good even with using high profile software like sibelius for good half of the day
wonderful super fast lightweight computer
the new macbook pro working good user experience fast speed faster start up time
this is what was looking for
it has wide screen and it easy to use
at my age need this kind of laptop
extremely slow
masterpiece of crap
not durable
slow processor just not it
can use the trackpad very well it too sensitive so hooked up mouse
external monitor worked easily
been using lenovo thinkpad edge laptops in our business for several years now and have no complaints about any of them
they have held up well not just in our sales department but also in our service department where they are exposed to dust exhaust grease oil and all manner of other non computer friendly substances
general quality laptop
the lenovo software that comes preinstalled may qualify as bloatware but is easily removed if you re not interested in it
windows rocks
computer runs very slow
great laptop
bigger screen than expected laptop with desktop design that is really nice to use for all types of usage including programming editing
one of the very few laptops still available with win pro multiple usb ports and dvd read write drive
only drawback is no led to show when the hard drive is being accessed
not necessity but something ve come to expect
does what need it to do and the price was right
great laptop from apple
apple is unrivaled in terms of build quality and functionality
the retina screen is absolutely beautiful and the touchpad is the best touchpad to date
the pair allow for seamless navigation throughout the whole interface
battery life is astonishing given the processing power and high resolution display
can easily get hours out of full charge
overall high quality laptop and great value considering all this computer has to offer
well worth the extra cost
size is perfect and display is beautiful
excellent performance especially given its price point
the screen is wide and provides excellent clarity
it is not small compact laptop but won be traveling via air often so its size and weight is not problem for me
can appreciate why she recommended it
don expect much in terms of performance from this laptop
it gets the job done in terms of having computer that can browse the web use word excel and the like
this laptop does not have an rj ethernet adapter for wired network connection
fast easy
so far do not have any trouble with it other than the picture quality is bit poor
have had it over month now and it works just fine
this laptop suits my needs as am currently studying online and just need computer for that purpose
my daughter uses it for college too and it works great for both of us
so gave this stars but only because of the poor picture quality other than that it is great buy
this laptop is absolutely horrible
bought it simply for excel on windows for work since have macbook air and literally the thing freezes and lags opening excel or my web browser
there is chance mine is defective but regardless not going to try another one this is terrible product
much rather bite the bullet and spend little more for product that actually meets minimum computing expectations for
appreciate the effort to hit affordable pricing dell but just not worth it
it is slow and complicated and very disappointing
great labtop
not as fast as would have liked it to be but everything else is great
ve only had this computer for few days an already don like it
the battery life is joke and it causing other problems
will be returning it
if people are writing bad reviews about this laptop then believe what they say
this is an ok computer
the processor shows speed of gz
the sound is disappointing
no bass sound at all
maybe this one is just dud
the computer is very wonderful
was not aware it did not have disk drive when bought it or would not of purchased it
it does have habit of restarting itself when you try to do the log in pw but over all im very satisfied
its very fast and very light
great product
am giviing it four stars instead of five because of no disk drive and the crashing
absolutely love my dell inspiron
it powers on off very quickly and it loads up automatically
the mouse click is bit loud but it really isn problem
for highly recommend
very poor quality lap top
am returning it
slow
great value laptop
can believe this was just
speed is great easy to set up and get going
very pleased so far
it is very difficult to use this computer
too many steps to get anywhere and hard to set up
this things run smoothly for its price and the battery life seems to go on forever
wasn disappointed in its performance
all in all it well worth its price tag
great laptop for the price
it was nearly impossible to find laptop that had side keyboard
dvd cd player
large hard drive instead of using the cloud
was under with shipping
the only con is windows effin
still giving it star rating because it is fast and nice sized screen
great for web design and general work
overall good but processing power isn very good
pro with pro upgrade is nice but it frequently freezes for few seconds here and there
replaced stock drive with wd black drive and is still quite slow
battery doesn last long web browsing hours maybe
it has some bloat wear that wish weren there
it works fine for pc in this price range
bought it for my parents late and they love it particularly the keyboard and screen
terrific value for the money
love the key layout and the built in mouse pad all work well and are properly sized
highly recommended
works good but doesn seem like it made sturdy
kinda to light and plastic feeling
killer computer
would highly recommend this computer it is fast
doesn have touch screen but have tablet so that wasn so important
look and feel is good
am experiencing the system little slower than what have expected
and processor feels pressured even though run medium scale programs watching the way exhaust speed increases
the hdd has scratching noise
the system sometimes lags lot
don like it at all
can put protector to make presentation
good value on quality product
easy setup and delivers all the functions we need
this laptop is amazing
despite the fact that there no optical drive everything is perfect
the screen resolution is crystal clear the speakers are amazing and the track pad is easy to use
the home page startup is easy to navigate which is the one thing was mainly concerned about
internet is fast and reliable battery life lasts long time
love this laptop
looks like this dell is piece of crap
it does not turn on if take the battery out it might work not sure if it bad battery or computer
do not recommend
awesome laptop
bootup time is amazing battery life is decent and it has great slim form factor
there is somewhat of learning curve but the operating system and hardware of this mac are great
more than enough for my use
the display is vibrant and clear the keyboard is well designed and pleasant to type on
even installed windows partition to be able to run windows software
things just work they are fluid easy to use and understand fast and work well
this computer is absolutely perfect for web browsing watching video word processing and that about it
if you want computer that plays games or any advanced tasks like editing video this computer is not for you
now when say don expect to play games on it mean it
pretty much every major game save for solitare won even play on it due to the slower processor
its also worth noting that there no bluetooth no mircophone jack no ethernet no dvd cd drive burner and no usb ports
it does come with two usb ports hdmi port and webcam
the webcam is nothing special its there if you need it
don expect it to take good pictures or video
the battery is pretty soild
it lasts up to hours with normal use
the computer itself runs very quiet and is mostly cool to the touch
the only major negative to me is windows though ymmv and the dell crapware installed
not bad for the price
needed an inexpensive laptop to do basic office work on that was lightweight and this fits the bill just fine
performance wise it bit slow but that to be expected from celeron class processor
also not fan of windows but fortunately can install whatever want on the laptop without issue
love everything about this laptop
sound quality and touchscreen are awesome
would definitely recommend this
love this laptop to the moon
my favorite colors black and red the matte material and the red backlight of the keyboard
the sound is great and it fast
the laptop is beautiful not extremely light but thin enough and wide screen with full keyboard
the touch screen response is fast and it picks up bluetooth and wifi fast
microsoft office is day trial number of games and apps are already preloaded
it exactly like the picture and am satisfied
great laptop light and very versatile
it was easy to set up
like the number pad for work so that nice
this is going to be random and unorganized but here are my thoughts on the laptop so far so good after month
it took some getting used to on the widows after being an xp user for many years
everything seems to be running smoothly
only downfall is the preloaded mcafee and other software
they are fine while the free subscription is going but pain when they start asking you to spend money every time you login
device is light weight quiet during operation and produces little to no heat
it has quick start up and shut down time
the display is good quality
just wish there were more usb ports
am impressed with this computer inexpensive but quality
love the size am using this for work am nurse and have to chart daily this is easy to use and have not had any problems with it
it so damn good bought
if you re the type of person that just likes to browse the internet and enjoy media and do light work with microsoft office this is the laptop for you
don expect it to be champion performer so if you want to play games or whatever this is not the computer for you
it extremely light weight and slim because of the lack of an optical drive who uses those anymore anyways so it easily fits into any college students bag
would recommend this to anyone who doesn need much out of computer
am very happy with this computer
it is exactly what expected and the price is excellent
you are getting what you pay for and in my opinion it is worth more
been using it for about hours now and it seems plenty fast and does everything need it to do
its very basic laptop
thought it would have cd rom drive but there isnt one
also wish it had port to plug an internet cord into it because sometimes my wifi router likes to not work
but for the price its good
other than the slow cpu it works great for everyday use
heavy gaming is definitely not it strong point
the cover is soft rubber texture without the friction
slick design and looks great
the machine is easy to use has the power it needs for personal use and some light professional work
it could be lighter but couldn everything
the battery seems adequate for most uses hour use charge
screen is clear and bright
glad it has the dvd drive
perfectly adequate
great pc
the is incredibly fast the ram makes it proper for several games not on maximum quality
great sound quality too
nice laptop
use it for school its quick and has everything need on it
good battery life as well
wifi card not working right out of the box
dealing with hp support is ridiculous and painful experience
have spent more than hours on the phone with them over different calls only to get no where
now looking into the return process which sure will just be loads of fun if my prior experience is any indication
seriously save yourself the hassle and purchase from different company
used to love hp products but this has soured me on the whole company
by far the best laptop ve ever had
its fast powerful screen display is top notch and the battery life is excellent for laptop of this size
my only concern is that since the battery is not external will not be able to change it out once it starts not to hold good charge over length of time
wonder if thats just apples way of saying its time to get the newest and greatest laptop years from now lol
the product is average and works well
works at decent speed
the mouse pad however is very loud which is why gave it four stars
had great experience purchasing my dell inspiron bk inch laptop
my laptop was easy to set up and ve had no problems to date
did not disappoint me at all
lenovo is the best laptop
built in mike is really poor and unusable for skype or any other purpose
and the only microphone input is for combo mike speaker plug
so to communicate need to wear ear plugs or headset with built in mike
that nuisance for family skype calls only one can speak at time
we haven used it enough or had it long enough to give it stars but so far it has been very good laptop
several other reviewers made comments on the keyboard and now can understand why this keyboard is the nicest to use of any laptop we ve ever owned
life long desktop computer user and the keyboard on this laptop is as close to normal keyboard as ve ever seen
we like this new laptop lot
very good performer for the price
not blazing fast but quick enough
one really nice thing about lenovo laptops is that they are not cluttered with bunch or trial software
the desktop was clean once got it up and running
battery life is above average and it charges quickly
keyboard is sturdy
the touch pad takes little getting used to as the click buttons are on top instead of the bottom
will be considering lenovo for all future laptop purchases
this lap top is good so far
it is quiet runs smoothly
really like the video option on it stream movies on amazon prime and netflix and there is no lag
the only negative would be that it gets pretty warm sitting on my lap for very long but that is pretty much standard for all lop tops think
it stopped working days after purchase
it was slow and might be problematic
would shop around for better one
crashed only days from getting it
says it is failing hard drive
should have bought something better
the pc is works well with good battery and power cable and has web cam
however it does not have dvd drive neither does it afford one the opportunity to connect an external dvd drive as the manufacturer did not make any point ofconnection of an external drive
other than hate of windows she just loves it
the plastic materials are rather cheap
love it
needs more instructions with it
very happy with my acer it does just for what need it
even the sound is fantastic
love this laptop
even my extremely tech savvy boyfriend was impressed with the features and sleek design
although ve had it for less than week am very satisfied
functions well
does all that was advertised
if it had star option that is what would give
the build is perfect the screen fantastic but do have bit of problem with the fact that have to buy adaptors for nearly everything from vga cables to ethernet cables so almost perfect
great display
love the color accuracy
very decent speakers
fairly fast
loud fan when watching video off youtube
sounds like washer
machine gets fairly hot near the bottom of the screen
battery power laptop had difficulties computing
still feels too heavy to me
could lose another pound or two
expensive
paid close to out the door
biggest piece of junk have ever purchased
this clunker however stopped working after only two weeks of having it delivered
it would have full charge yet would turn itself off for no explainable reason after being on for minutes
the second one after little over month refused to turn on even with full charge
what lemon
this is big disappointment
only use laptop for personal use but this one can even handle that
it takes long time to load any page
ve had it for minth and so far it shut down completely times
have had dell desktops for years so had no qualms about buying dell laptop
never again
ve always sworn by dell
so with this new order all the upgrades and windows really caught my eye and got this for the long haul
am not ultra tech savvy but can tell when it works slow
barely have any files or downloads and its almost impossible to get this thing to load
so disappointed
in two months both the power cord pin broke the company replaced it and then the cd drive literally jumped out of the laptop unannounced and shattered into million pieces
in addition no matter what do to change the settings add delete flash etc firefox hangs on start up
it seems like lenovo also makes weird choices about which side to put the powercord and other slots on
the cords always feel like they are in my way
one positive aspect of this laptop is the keyboard which is larger than usual
it pleasure to type on
my final thoughts if you are mac user stay away
if you want to travel with this laptop don buy it
it clunky heavy and pain to start up and shut down
great for games
it truly great laptop for the price
however this laptop far exceeded my expectations when bought it for college only use malwarebytes and microsoft security essentials run virus scan maybe once week and it has ran smoother than butter for the past two years
for which is as much as my graphics card alone cost this laptop is an incredible value
it is quite impressive at multitasking which really surprised me
can have tabs open while playing youtube videos and it handles it impressively well
but should tell you that this laptop does not have the best screen it certainly good enough for the average person but if you re used to good screens this may bother you bit but it certainly not unbearable by anyone standards
if you want to game this thing can handle league of legends on medium low settings but certainly wouldn recommend it for gaming
overall great laptop for simply doing basic things and web browsing
would definitely recommend for those who are technologically ignorant
this computer is very slow
love this laptop
it does everything need it too
very good price
very nice computer
immediately didn like the track buttons
they are loud and clunky but figured get used to it
the laptop died two days after received it
purchased dell inspiron bk and so far love it this model has true life monitor which is worth the extra bucks
if you re looking for basic pc this is the way to go
the hinges on this pc are nice and tight and well made like the rest of the pc
was surprised at the overall quality and the price
in all my life have never come across computer as slow as this one it cant perform basic operations and is practically useless
just received the laptop and if it runs like this already cant imagine how it would work in the next couple of weeks
it took almost minutes to boot up
please people dont make the same mistake did
this is complete waste of money dont let the price fool you
would be very nice laptop if the mousepad worked properly
it was not responsive at all to touch
and while tapping the mousepad to try to get it to work your palm would inevitably touch the side which would pull up the side windows and block your ability to find the mouse
if they can fix this think it would be very nice cost effective laptop
this laptop broke within the first hour of use
the key became jammed so that sometimes it wouldn press in
dell claims they test each key with thousands of mechanical key strokes
also after restarting the laptop it constantly made high pitched electronic noises
sure just got bad egg but instead of getting replacement decided to try different one
this laptop is nice
it has decent feel to it sharp display and is fast enough
the biggest problem have is the right side and top of the touchpad is unresponsive
have updated the drivers and tweeked every feature available but nothing has helped
also the touchpad is almost sticky which kind of defeats the purpose of touchpad
would love to keep this laptop but will be sending it back and looking for different brand
no lenovo for me
initially liked the product so much
although it was slow but felt it was ok for the price you have bought it
but now am having battery problems
laptop automatically shuts down when battery life reaches
am not satisfied with the product
it an amazing laptop
most of the things about the laptop is awesome except the touchpad
the laptop is fast
the windows used to boot in just and that was freaking awesome
now have dual booted my laptop to windows and ubuntu and it not got too slow either
am loving it completely
it does make little noise but that alright as it not too much
it doesn get heated up much even after continuous usage
but the touchpad is soooooooooo big that whenever am typing my palm touches some part of it and then the cursor goes somewhere else and it really annoying
prefer typing without having to see the keyboard but due the large touchpad always have to type cautiously as my hand might take me somewhere else
smaller touchpad would make life easier for computer science students or it people much more easier
uhhhhhh the computer looks good
but it works really slowwwwww
it has got me feel like to take years to successfully open web page
purchased it for my birthday and love it
so glad that have
it been very easy transition moving my windows created files over to the mac
so far haven lost any quality or information
have little bit of learning curve with the keyboard shortcuts
but other than that really am loving the quality and speed
expensive but worth it
the display has great resolution but have difficulty always seeing the small print
haven quite figured out how to make the font size larger overall
this is without doubt the worst laptop ve ever had
and of course the return window closed last week so now stuck with it
will never buy another lenovo anything
unless you plan on using mouse with this laptop don buy this
the touchpad hasn worked correctly since delivery though in the beginning thought perhaps it was just bit of quirk since most touchpads ve worked with have some inherent oddities
this one however is now very loose and have to either tap hard or repeatedly push to click in order for it to work then suddenly can barely touch it at all and it clicks on its own
today it hasn worked at all more than it has
it hangs freezes and just isn working properly
have now been waiting almost minute for the computer management window to open
though don have much installed only have of the left
have no idea what taking up all the room it doesn make sense
could go on and on but suffice it to say if you want to spend on laptop don buy this one
it definitely not worth the money
very fast and good for most steam games
don expect great graphics though
the keyboard and sound are great and the matte screen works well
can run cs go at fps on low settings
computer was doa
turned it on and it was beeping
love this laptop
looks good well built and very good speed
needed usb adapt for network plug no problem
keyboard is nice and windows is great worried about that coming from xp
price makes this the laptop was looking for
so far am very happy with this computer
it has everything wanted built in wi fi connectibility slot for my sd camera memory card dvd burner big beautiful screen plenty of usb ports three and one and keyboard with nice touch
liked the fact that it came with windows but also included windows to install later if need it
the price was good
use wireless mouse but the touch pad and the red button in the middle that works like little joystick also work fine
wish had bought this sooner
this is great bargain
yes it running and old type processor so hey don even try gaming on it
but if you are just an average user it works really great
the screen is good the whole things is very light and doesn run hot
very happy with it typing on it right now and it is fast enough for that
like everything about this laptop
it has no way of connecting to the internet save wifi but that all use anyway
put that free app on for word processing and it works like charm
plugged it into my existing printers and it just worked no fuss no muss
it immediately recognized the printer and was ready to go
excellent buy
the worst computer have ever laid my eyes upon
firstly it has no leds to let you know what is going on no cap lock no hard drive indicator nothing
ok one light to let you know if the damn thing is on
the biggie though is the fact that it disconnects from the internet whenever if feels like it even when the strength bar is filled
also when you try to download large file like video it will start out normally downloading at around kb sec and over the course of couple of minutes will slow waaaaaay down to around kb sec making download of couple minutes into several hours making it worthless
too often would find it not being able to stay connected to the internet
was unable to download itunes to it
dell support was awful to deal with
and the settings are simply annoying
just not for me
the computer is as expected and worth the money
the windows is major disappointment
operating non touch screen on this system is royal pain
it came with no instruction book no back up cd and has already crashed
hands down one of my best and most used purchases thus far
the mid macbook pro does no disappoint
retina screen solid build quality weight fast processor and the reliability of the apple brand
cons honestly zero con as windows pc user the switch over was seamlessly run parallel when need windows
all my devices work flawlessly
an amature so this does more than can handle
perfectly satisfied just have to get use to the new system can see problem
doi ng fine now and happy as bug
the price is great and it does everything want to do thanks
it perfect
it great for what he uses it for
am really not happy with this computer
don like windows but that is no fault of the computer but the keyboard is so hard to get the keys to work and the space bar
would not buy it again
meh but cheap
the first thing can say for positive is that the laptop is very light makes it really portable this with relatively clear screen is bonus
now the graphics are not hd and the reason that it is light is that it is really basic medium low grade plastic
so if you don have kids or not in high school or don accidently sit on it it should be fine
now the speed is disappointing
start up is fine maybe secs at most but then to get pages to load on internet is molasses at times
even for gb ram it barely chugs with tabs open
all in all wish had waited bit
this laptop is amazing
windows has its pros and cons
the keyboard is backlit but you have to press the key to turn it on
of course this will decrease your battery life
the sound is very nice and crisp
also have no regrets about going with the gb ram because its super fast
still exploring the various features but overall am satisfied with my purchase
the hp envy has been everything expected
after doing much research for laptop that had all the features was looking for this one hit all the criteria had
the laptop is very responsice with the core processor and gb of ram and the sound out of the beats audio is great
would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for top performing laptop
used times black screen returned for refund
do not use the facial recognition
windows is not supported by lot of things
the dell is quick enough sturdy not good with finger prints
it does what it advertises
price is great wish it didn have windows but that is an opinion
would recommend it for anybody needing reliable simple laptop
bought this for my daughter to use for school and homework it not fast computer but it great for what she needs it for and very light weight
love the price too
well my first apple computer and am impressed
works well fast and no reboots
glad did so far
rea llllyy slow
like seriously really slow
impossible to use
cant even read properly
plus no russian input wtf
what great laptop can run my games and work really fast
really light you can carry with you everywhere
great battery life
everything at very great price
completely recommend it
excellent value and must buy for someone looking for macbook
you can get any better than this price and it come with an internal disk drive
plus you get gb which is also great feature
also the resale value on this will keep
highly recommend you get one before they are gone
got this on black friday with very good discount and couldn be happier
the screen is great don see the need for retina display
also really like the addition of the sd card slot
this macbook pro is amazing
if you are afraid of it not having disc player please don be
love the new high retina display and because this computer lacks disc player it makes it significantly lighter
overall this is fast light practical computer and highly recommend it
bought my macbook pro in october of and years later it still works as flawless as ever
ve never had any problems with the computer itself the macbook charger chords are another story though
tried not to jump on the apple bandwagon but you re just living in denial if you don
happy buying
bought this laptop from best buy in january still loving it
can use it as tablet as laptop as whatever want to
play sims and on it all the time with very little issues
the thing wakes up super fast and is always ready to go
music videos sound great and look great
use it everyday
my favorite computer ve ever had
this computer overall is great
it runs fast
ships fast
etc but the company and seller lied to you and try to make an extra buck
bought this pc to play games and stream movies it could handle all of that but my friend wanted me to put some music on cd
could see the disk drive on the side but it didn seem to have button on it
disk drive with buttons on it
and he said quot this computer does not have disk drive and was furious
so beware buyer this computer has useless piece of plastic on it
thank you asus they don deserve to be capitalized
great computer
very great apple product as expected
good battery life
great color on screen
good speakers from laptop computer
my new laptop is great
it has so much more speed and the screen is very sharp
have to admit that the operating system is different and does take time to learn but like it
would recommend it to anyone
this laptop is fine for those applications and basic websurfing
the speakers are fairly basic so this is probably not the computer to buy if your main aim is streaming music or watching movies
the touchpad is little quot clunky quot for my taste use small external mouse with laptops in any event
appreciate the relatively large keyboard with number pad and screen size
also found the track pad irritating until disabled quot pinch zoom quot
this is larger laptop but is not too heavy
battery life is great though it is new
overall solid laptop for its price
however few things are immediately occurring to me had read the other reviews here on amazon but decided the specs and appearance looked good enough to go ahead
well my first impressions are that its ok it certainly boots up quickly thanks ssd and from the limited use so far no games its fast enough in normal usage
it certainly looks nice but that nice dark blue top is fingerprint magnet as others have pointed out
also have found the touch pad to be awkward to use could be am pressing too hard perhaps and the screen is well underwhelming
to be honest am little disappointed and considering returning it
this is horrible laptop
within day of usage it already slowed down significantly virus entered the system right away
it heavy
regretted immediately
nothing like the description says
my apple mac book pro has crashed three times since purchased it
each time apple can only uninstall to original factory settings for me to start over
believe this macbook pro was lemon right out the gate

this computer is like lost for words
this is the best switch have ever done
this has much more memory and ram memory
even the battery life is like wow
love love loooove
can say that am fully satisfied with the performance that the computer has supplied
it contains long battery life incredible specs and an overall enjoyable performance
upgrading from toshiba laptop am fully impressed with all of the benefits that the mac operating system provides
the snappy processor allows for me to quickly upload photos and videos as well as create movies for me and my colleagues to enjoy
in upgrading to this computer can say have found little to any flaws in the product hence the star review
love this computer
it has done everything and more that expected
am sure it will be able to do all need it to do in the future as well
the screen looks great in my opinion the sound is nice
so far have no complaints and dont expect many complaints in the future
this did give some set trouble and had to call tech support
they were great
its been easy breezy since then
how could you not love mac
so far so good have not encountered any issues with this computer
love the flip feature and the touch screen feature
for the price that paid feel that got good value
this lap top is not the lightest you can purchase so if that is important to you maybe you should shop some more
to prospective buyer once you go mac you ll never go back
was the best decision we ever made
it runs just as fast as the day we got it with no problems
we don have to de frag deliete cookies run security programs or any of the common pc problems that have to be delt with in order to keep you running and up to speed
you can get virus on mac so in the long run the cost of the mac is saved by not buying security and not having to replace your computer every year or two
never had any issues no frustrations just great easy wireless all in one fun
it great
because it is touch screen you don even need mouse
you will probably never use it in tablet mode but it nice to know you have that option
if you draw on the other hand sure you will love using this in tablet mode
lastly because it can flip you can comfortably lay down in bed and have the keyboard facing down as you watch show closer without having to adjust your sitting position for the keyboard
this computer is great
have gb ssd and gb of ram in it which installed myself
it runs faster than it did when got it
enjoy the simplicity and user friendly interface of yosemite
excited for el capitan
the apps are very easy to use
the resolution is excellent
am very satisfied with everything about this machine
like so many others who do this there is learning curve and excited to do it
this mbp is clean neat and simple
like that
it takes less time to power up and if you just close the case it go into sleep mode
when you open it wakes up almost immediately
very nice
am pleased with my decision however have only had this for few weeks
there are few things am dissappointed with though
only usb ports
no hdmi port
the headphones jack is combo jack for the headphones and microphone
not big deal for me but if you skype lot or are gaming regular headphone set with separate jack for the headphone sound and microphone input will not work on mac
as student majoring computer science really fell in love with this laptop
it inches which for me is not too big nor too small
it has the latest cpu with gtx for gpu which makes this laptop blazing fast boots up in under seconds with the help of the ssd of course
it has gb ssd which is just enough for my os games documents and anything in between
it also has an extra bay for an extra hdd if you wish to add one
it not touchscreen
its keyboard is nicely arranged silent and back lit which is nice but what don like about it is the material attracts oil from your fingers
have to clean it regularly for it to stay looking good
this laptop is so silent its fans only kick in when the laptop is under heavy load thanks to the th generation intel core which draws less power thus less heat
it can run games really well
well not really well
mobas like dota and smite can be run on max quality settings with fps or more
medium settings on titles like tomb raider for it to be acceptable fps is the minimum acceptable fps pcmasterrace
it lightweight and easy to carry around
the screen is matte display which is nice but with poor viewing angle
find myself adjusting it regularly
it looks sleek and gorgeous
blends in with any accessory you use with it
all in all am very happy with this purchase
and with this price don think you can buy anything better
all can say is am impressed
very quick to get it up and running with minimum setup time right after you open the box
it worth it
pay me now pay me later am happy with my choice going with this laptop
was disappointed
it seemed like great computer and great deal
the first one arrived and it did not work
the space bar sticks
find it hard to navigate from screen to screen
for non computer savvy person it was very disappointing
like the inch macbooks
its size is ideal and the weight is acceptable
the new mac os mountain lion has some nice features as wel as the trackpad
didn think would need an optical drive but since have had it used it several times
the magnetic lid and charger is cool and battery indicator on the side is cool
the mac is light and so compact thought would regret not buying retina display not in the least the mac pro works just fine
the os is easy and offers all kinds of surprises
ve been using apple since and this is the fastest and best one ve had
this mac allows all of that
this is very fast high performance computer
this should be more than enough computer for almost everyone
would not hesitate recommending this to anyone
it fast and easy to set up
had cloned my data from my old computer using carbon copy cloner ccc and simply moved everything to the new computer and was off and running at speeds had only dreamed up before
the mac book pro is computer for the disorganized lazy and eye candy person in all of us
the macbook pro already understands how to jump through hoops and acts more like friendly guide
if you want to use the internet then you can make your icons jump out from the bottom of the screen like magnifying glass is projecting onto the selected icon
this computer is amazing for the individual who does not want to do any extra work via their understanding of their laptop
would ve given stars had it not been for the hours of updates ve had to do to this upon arrival
other than that love it
it portable reliable and great for what use it for
positives no matter what position this laptop will stay in it
it very sturdy
quick boot up and runs efficiently
touchscreen is great
negatives as aforementioned my only con was the updates
everything you expect from mac
it looks and feels solid with flawless finish
the screen definition is superb and it fires up super quick and same to close down
only had it few weeks but doesn leave my side
this machine is flawless fast and classy
out of all the laptops have owned this is by far the best
not sure if it was covered in the description but it does have backlit keyboard and getting about an hour battery life on one charge except don use this for games or videos which obviously would drain the battery faster
it wakes in less than second when open the lid
the screen has an extremely high resolution that very pleased with
even though macbooks are expensive you will see that they are well worth the money
you will not regret buying this computer
my daughter macbook air battery bulged deforming the keyboard several days ago
it took days to make an appointment at the local apple store
not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with piece of paper in her hand for new battery to replace it and for new keyboard
could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so went to the apple store myself and asked for manager
he explained to me the battery expansion is normal
apple doesn cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their apple care
the battery is simply considered consumable and not covered
asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the macbook air on the internet with the description that apple doesn consider the product defective
his reply astonished me looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said make sure you have your facts straight before you smear
he didn specify who are they but from the tone of his voice and his posture it indicated something between the swat team and bunch of lawyers
here is my take on all of this the business model apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from china hire bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school call them geniuses and bully everybody who complains about their product
steve jobs is dead so is apple
no more apple devices in my household
please google macbook battery bulge explode before you buy your next apple toy
ve been spoiled by the build quality and stability of macintosh and even this used computer is gem
can bat around all the things that everyone else says but it been what we ve been using for decades and have nothing bad to say
it churns out hd content runs without many flaws and ve yet to get virus on mac since started using the platform in the early
my amp macbook motherboard fried but think that was sugar spill that never bothered cleaning up
that the only issue ve ever had since working on macs in
that pretty impressive track record don you think
however the hp envy has definitely met all of my expectations and more
have been thoroughly impressed with my purchase thus far and do not regret purchasing it at all
while the price may seem high it is worth every penny with its many perks
the pros ton of storage space this laptop comes with gb of memory and tb gb hard drive
that is plenty of space for your laptop which really comes in handy for college students and computer gamers
in capability the ease of switching this laptop into tablet is huge plus
if you are looking to get in laptop this is the laptop you should consider
love the flexibility of being able to fold it over like tent and watch movies without having the keyboard in the way of things
find it much easier to type on and much more durable
battery life my battery life is really good with this laptop and have had no problems with it thus far
can usually go about hours before get down to battery life
the cons no disc drive call me old fashioned but still enjoy listening to physical cds and uploading them to itunes
however can no longer do this because this laptop does not contain disc drive
overall definitely would recommend this product to any college student that is in the market for new laptop
the touchscreen and in capability is huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes
it also is nice to be able to play candy crush or angry birds when in between classes straight from your laptop
it makes it much more exciting to play
actually writing this review on my new macbook and love it
the computer it self is amazing
it is an older model so know that upfront but it is everything was looking for
from the moment received this macbook it was like dream come true
know once upgrade the ram to gb it will pick up lot
also if after reading some reviews and doing some research found out that this laptop is easily upgradable and easy to work on which is another big plus
so long story short if you want an oldie but goodie this is your laptop
know people were complaining that it isn the newest model but it all depends on what you are looking for
highly recommend
this computer is fantastic tool for word processing searching the internet and keeping track of everyday life
it also incredibly light has battery that can last for days and looks like piece of art
though that pretty much what your paying for well designed device
when you look at the internal specs the computer is only worth about
it has gb storage capacity but with the option of gb hard drive and ghz dual core intel core so don expect to be gaming on this computer and make sure you pick up an external hard drive too
if your looking to be trendy hipster who can live without mac it great buy
it mixes great balance between the spec that are needed and what you don need
pros nice looks
keyboard is great
wanted simple full hd display and this one does its job
sound is great
and this has extra slot for hdd
no cd drive
cons web cam
vga really asus
you don want to show this to anyone
anyway don use webcam much so don care
viewing angles are not great
remember its dual core
the fan kicks in even its not too hot
found the track pad not great
use my mouse so not problem for me
over all very good system and worth it
this was the only tablet style computer so far which met my requirements
was seduced by this computer so took it home
the wireless keyboard not bluetooth but rf did not pair up with the device
it still did not pair
even ran it as administrator still no effect
used the ctrl esc keys while turning on and still nothing
it flickers briefly to green before the light goes out
still can pair it
don want to carry around bluetooth keyboard for computer whose keyboard is nonfunctional
sony can eat the cost from the seller on this one while get my money back for defective product
but sony doesn seem to have addressed it
my first mac computer and as many before me just fall in love with it
changed the memory from gb to gb corsair vengeance and gb hdd rpm with seagate hybride gb hdd ssd
machine is flying and with parallels desktop have my old pc notebook completely functional on my mbp
way to go and enjoy both worlds
this asus you re looking at right here and that typing on right now has one
with that being said for the price you get nice fast laptop but if you ask me it missing some things that feel should be automatically included
this laptop has no touchscreen optical drives ok bit of stretch because that would eat up precious space in this monster swivel or detachable screen
what this laptop does have is windows which is confusing as all get out tons of amp bloatware amp
this is really nice but hate the awkward right mouse clicking sometimes it works sometimes it doesn may be the laptop may be the laptop in conjunction with windows
either way highly annoying
hooked up usb mouse and all is well
all works beautifully but windows is taking bit of getting used to
love the degree rotation and the touch screen works great but little bit of learning curve there too as sometimes have to tap few times to get the exact location need
overall it is just my learning few things than any downfall with the laptop the mouse was the only negative could really see
this is fantastic transformer
loved playing with it and the touchscreen was great for the windows platform
the only reason returned it was because bought it to use the touchscreen with photoshop and because of the program it could not utilize the touchscreen within the work space except to zoom and rotate
would have kept it but that was the sole reason for my purchase
it great product and would recommend to anyone looking for transformer or large touchscreen
looking forward to needing laptop update so can purchase this computer again
ve only had this for week overall like the computer it thin amp light and the wireless keyboard works great
was impressed sony puts in small touches like usb charging port on the charger
one thing did like is the stylus holder it cheap plastic and doesn seem to be well thought out because it gets installed on the cover for the usb port
do use it think would accidently break it and loose my stylus
the other issue had was the amount of time it takes to update the operating system and all the software when you get it
awesome laptop for college
can be used for gaming as well
it light fast and has great battery
it steal when considering the specs and performance as well
the processor and gpu are fantastic at running games and multiple apps
can run most games to good quality without seeing any lack of speed
the backlit keyboard is nice touch especially
make sure to only handle this computer with clean hands because the front cover can get oily pretty fast
overall very pleased with my new laptop
the only downside are the speakers
they don go very loud at all
the quality of the sound is nice but the lack of volume really kills it for me
this is mostly not an issue since mainly use earbuds anyways however it could be annoying at times
the screen looked fine to me and wasn an issue like others have been saying
overall great for me
this laptop has delivered
immediately did the windows upgrade and haven had any issues
the wireless adapter is strong and the ssd is fast
this thing boots in just few seconds which is nice
others have mentioned issues with viewing angle on the screen but never use the laptop where not looking straight at it so it doesn bother me
very pleased with the purchase
boot time is super fast around anywhere from seconds to minute
apps launch super fast and the gb hdd is more than sufficient
usually use my mac for school work and internet browsing so the entry level macbook pro is already more than what expected from computer would typically use it for
macs hardly ever get viruses and they are completely incompatible with existing microsoft windows viruses
furthermore mac os mountain lion gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed
the keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are back lit which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing typing
overall the screen resolution though non retina is sufficient for normal web browsing and work
the thunderbolt port is awesome
us comes with the mbp and has transfer rates of up to gbps
other ports include firewire gigabit ethernet magsafe port microphone jack
sdhc card reader and an optical drive for burning and reading discs
the glass track pad is large enough for apple highly acclaimed multi touch gestures for scrolling through web pages with two fingers zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers
for windows users switching to mac you can also enable right clicking known to apple as secondary click in the system preferences gt mouse and enabling right clicking
the unique to apple aluminium uni body is real beauty
it makes the mbp very durable and protects it from scratches though you shouldn go launching it against wall for the sake of trying it
the mac app store and itunes store are phenomenal
the mac app store is your one stop shop for mac software though you can also download software online at your own risk
there are currently around apps on the app store and counting and billions of songs available for download fro the itunes store
itunes is one of the better media players available on the market with it simple to use user interface
sure you won regret making this purchase
one of the worst pieces of electronics have ever bought
very pour performance
it takes for ever to wake it up
sometimes it stops receiving wifi signal so have to restart it
it is very slow and not responsive
would not recommend
glare is also pretty frustrating
there is definitely more to say
tested it it worked great
he received it and one day later it dies
the laptop refuses to start we have troubleshooted all areas still fails to start
cannot even get to bios
just click and black screen
of course it dies days past the return window
we got two days of operation from this laptop
when the macbook pro arrived helped her transfer all of her schoolwork from the pc to the mac an easy drag and drop process utilizing flash drive
it was delivered with gb of ram gb on each of two sticks which was probably adequate
so simply pulled one gb stick from the machine and installed the gb stick in its place
the machine now has gigs of ram and it works just fine
but hey it an apple
wouldn expect anything less
if it was possible to give them start would have done it
my laptop one of the key from keyboard came out and it was mechanical failure
my laptop was under coverage but when gave it to them for repairs they quoted me for it
this company just wants customers money in their pocket
they dont care how you feel when they charge you hundreds of hard earned dollars
wish this company to go bust
will never ever buy any apple product in my life
overall love it
first when move the screen to put it in tablet position the hinge doesn seem totally solid
feel like need to be really gentle with it but maybe that just me
also and this maybe is another personal quirk but the keyboard sits little far back for my taste so my watch scrapes against the edge of the laptop
first off amazing laptop
three years ago had purchased this bad boy and it still runs great
if were to have any technical difficulties the local apple and contact line were able to help me asap it was quite impressive
myself had purchased the gig drive laptop and as dj with thousands of songs pictures and other things and after years have managed to fill around of my gigs
there is so much room
pros amazing storage both gig and gig
gig ram needed if you are as productive as am dj photography movie making etc its quick
no anti spyware needed never had virus and never will
build solid and durable
bought the year warranty and boy it was needed because of my doings
cons if you fall behind in updates your laptop will become progressively slower just update it then its back to normal
sometimes when stared mine up it would take few extra minutes to boot on other times it is few seconds
cannot manually take battery out unless you work for apple or have the tools
overall it is fantastic laptop
mine has been though hundreds of parties weddings quinces anything involving performances it can take it
this laptop was made for art music beat making pictures movies graphic design
by the way it comes with apps and hardware that can already support what had just listed
this laptop will last you half decade if not full decade
soon will be hitting the year mark and think this thing can make it another in my opinion
get this now
by the way paid for this particular laptop roughly grand look at the price now
this is great laptop
bought it for college and couldn be happier
the ssd and complement each other really well
was pretty skeptical about upgrading to windows but it is pretty awesome
if you are looking for light durable and extremely effecient laptop buy this one
they really know what they are doing
the laptop is so easy to work with
like it was designed for what people would want to the system to do very user friendly
its simplicity is one of the things that makes it so great aside from its quality design and sexy looks
if you dont like windows would suggest trying mac
the investment is worth it
have bought several laptops in last several years and hands down this has been the best ever
mac user interface is just the best
also the laptop is quite no more burnt laps best screen display and small additions like backlit keyboard wins your heart over
only thing dislike is that everything for mac is expensive but guess you pay for quality
not impressed with macintosh products
in fact am completely frustrated
also many software programs are not compatible with the ios platform
be sure the programs you need will work on mac before you buy one
had heard people speak highly of the macbook pro for college students and have not been disappointed through two and half years of extensive use
the macbook pro is useful for college students for many reasons
it is the cheapest product in the line of macbook
the new operating system called snow leopard is installed and ready for use
the battery life has increased from the last version from hours to hours making it easy for college students to study for extended periods of time without needing charger
reliability throughout the past few years have had no problems with the macbook pro regarding the processing system or any design flaws
durability my computer has fallen from small heights and has had few spills on it but has had no lasting damage to the console with only light plastic case on it
usability the macbook pro is very easy to use and can be used by someone who doesn necessarily have extensive knowledge on computers
the processing system is already downloaded and the applications are very user friendly
the macbook pro has significant amount of positive attributes that greatly outweigh the negative attributes
pros it usually runs very smoothly but apple has an excellent support team that is always willing to help customers
it has an extended battery life
it is extremely user friendly
cons some people don enjoy the way the processing system runs but don have any issues with getting it to function
others have problems with the applications depending what they need to use the device for for example engineering majors need extra applications amp systems to do some work but they are easily downloadable
my first laptop ever and it is flips into tablet mode also brilliant
so far so good
battery doesn hold up to what it said in the description but got it refurb and imagine they swapped out the battery to help cover the costs on the reduced price just guess
still getting used to typing on it my palms keep hitting the mousepad and causing the cursor to jump and moving me off of where was typing
plenty of ports and since this is my first laptop really don have anything to compare it to
note no dvd drive no ethernet port
screen is too small to read and almost impossible to touch with normal adult finger
the brightest screen setting appeared dim in normal room light
keyboard is flimsy and mediocre at best
the touch pad feel is on scale
computer seemed sluggish for an intel core device
power on good luck finding it
would run back to computer store and return this expensive toy
signed not impressed
bought this few months ago and it holding up fairly well
runs fast the touch screen hasn lost any sensitivity overall very happy with it
this one doesn do that
the trackpad is pretty crappy but aren they all
this is my first apple computer and couldn be more pleased
ios does everything its billed to do and much much more
literally every detail has been thought out and designed with the user in mind
can believe how much time it saves me through automatic processes
the computer of the people
love this laptop
the batter lasts as long as claimed
get about or so hours playing the sims
haven really officially tested it yet but it long time
hate plugging my laptop in because don want to leave it on too long and hurt the battery but with this laptop rarely have to charge it
the touchscreen is responsive and even works with my crappy dollar stylus
the only problem have is with windows
hate windows
it made me sign up with microsoft and sometimes won let me download things that are harmful to my computer but that what anti virus software is for lol
the wifi rumor hasn happened to me
the wifi works great
it feels very well built
the metal is very expensive feeling
the laptop is little more than an inch thick when closed
very weak girl and could lift this laptop with one hand however get tired soon lol
the amp screen is not good for carrying around in your bare hands
bought my first macbook exactly months ago and was really happy with my new toy but what was not my surprise when turned it on days ago and the screen was completely black
can hear the noise of the computer turning on and the lights also turn on but the screen in completely dead
the best computer ve ever bought
the simple look of icons and format makes it easy to navigate through programs and download files
the only issue had was with the harddrive
the harddrive crashed and thought had lost the whole computer
replacing the harddrive in this laptop is extremely easy couple screws on the back to remove the backplate and the harddrive is pretty much plug and play
and apple was happy to install the latest osx for free
you wont be disappointed with this computer
it just matter of getting used to the touch pad commands
thankfully have earphones and an external amplifier for audio the onboard speakers are just terrible
but what should expect from unit that is this thin and this light
the most disappointing purchase of my life
received dud and have had nothing but problems since right after purchased this horrible machine
within the first few months that bought it there was clearly problem with the hard drive
the online customer service was awful
gave me the runaround for an entire day and treated me like an imbecile
no one would ever answer my question as to why couldn get another new macbook since this was clearly factory error and my macbook was still under warranty
as matter of fact no matter how many times asked that question the employees spoke purposely ignored it
they didn say yes and they didn say no they just pretended that never asked it which was incredibly frustrating
ve been to the amp genius amp bar several times they have been very nice
they have now basically replaced everything inside my machine told me there was problem with the hardware so now have amp refurbished amp machine
maybe not being reasonable but don feel that the same as new computer because didn pay for refurbished computer
still have weird freezing problems with it and it pretty slow but it not pinpointed enough yet for me to take it in
had delusions of grandeur regarding apple amp great customer service amp and the amp reliability of their machines amp etc etc blah blah
sure most people macbooks work just fine but fyi if you get the factory dud you re stuck with it and no one at apple cares or will give hoot about the money you threw away
one os for this platform no oem os paraphernalia and automatic updates
am happy with the feel the speed and the seamless transition to the mac
well she was right whatever in the world took me so long to get computer that just works
no power user but have had no learning curve with the mac and don do anything geeky enough forcing me to learn the os
did buy office for the mac at very low price to migrate most of my work files for and that was steal in my opinion
otherwise am happily mac user
for premium laptop sold in the apple macbook pro inch base model is about as basic as it gets no ssd no discrete graphics no display and no touch screen
but apple does not pretend it has any of these
what it does have is great reliability on the software side and hardware side apple osx mountain lion the sleek looks apple always delivers reasonable specs good battery life nice keyboard and excellent trackpad
those looking for bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use macs
the macbook pro inch laptop is for those who want to use mac but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution
this mac will last longer than any other simply because it is the easiest to upgrade and repair
hard drives can be replaced ram can be added as needed and the internal battery can be replaced after losing its ability to hold charge
this added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money detracts from the computer value
lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer five star purchase but for the price this is four star good computer
tldr version good reliable laptop with mediocre screen and slow hard drive
am really sorry bought this machine
was shocked at how much worse this product has been since my first purchase
this machine has made me go there times and has been nothing but continuous problem
finally they are sending it in for motherboard replacement
it lemon
so cooled on mac buys
they did not replace the motherboard
instead they tightened loose wire
it also has big new scratch on the top cover
started it up and it still has the same problem went in to fix
so going back to genius bar for visit
think it may have to be apple don care instead of apple care
you get what you pay for right
mac is complicated and frustrating at moments
watched tutorials and that helped somewhat but not enough
should have known better
hope you don make the same mistake
when first got the computer noticed the tracking pad was hard to click
took my macbook to the apple store and they had to replace the battery after month of use since it was swelling
they tried to tell me that the battery wasn covered by the warranty and it costs about to replace
they ended up not charging me
other than that battery issue and the battery life does not last too long pretty happy with the computer
designer turned front end developer and this computer is unusable for front end development
opening photoshop takes fooooooorrrever as do all programs that do not begin with an
the free upgrade to mountain lion failed
it tried to boot up and the screen just flashed over and over and over again
before and after resolved that issue saw the damn beachball all the time as the computer tries to figure out what the hell it doing while wait for it
spend so much time waiting for it
can believe people like these computers
now that they are not virus free see absolutely no benefit to apple products as they are slower more expensive and do not last as long
don waste your money
my hp seemed great at first then the problems started wireless adapter would just quot disappear quot and the system said it didn have network card
sometimes it comes back sometimes not
hp was no help
the lettering wore off the keys so you better be able to type blind
the battery lasted months then pffft gone
when had boot up issue the hp recovery didn work
the disks made wouldn work hp support stated quot we re hardware company not software company quot
then there was power cord recall hp never notified us and we did register never again
don have the inclination or time to devote to companies tech support search functions or hold times dropped the hp and never looked back
gave this product stars because have been looking for macbook pro for long time and found it here for wonderful price
have used this product for only days but can wait to use it more
really like mac apple products because of their operating system
can tweet and use facebook from the sidebar which is really nice
also like have the option to push calendars photos and contacts to an ipad ipod touch or iphone if had any of those
the only thing have had trouble with so far is transferring music to itunes which would have liked to do though amp home sharing amp used itunes on computer separate from my linux computer but could not figure that out
just ended up using my ipod to transfer my itunes music and re downloaded my amazon music losing my ratings
have not tried gaming on it but have heard that mac apple does not do games well
plan on using my macbook pro for long time
when decided to buy my first computer wish had bought mac first
if the price doesn deter you you ll find it well worth it in terms of trouble free operation
ve had it for more than year and ve found that no anti virus software is needed as long as you don download anything without being sure that it from legitimate source
from time to time get the spinning beach ball that holds up progress
can almost always fix that quickly by clicking on the show all bookmarks icon the open book icon at the upper left
once in long while that doesn work in that case turn the computer off then on again and sign in problem solved
ll leave the more technical aspects to those more knowledgeable than myself and just conclude by saying that delighted with my purchase
received this item and everything is great except that my touchpad is reversed
to go left have to go right and vice versa and to go up have to go down
when attach mouse it fine but the touchpad is really annoying
went through the settings and there isn way to fix it
it great laptop but right now it annoying to use the touchpad
